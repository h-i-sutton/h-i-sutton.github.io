[![](/images/Icon_Bluesky.jpg)](https://bsky.app/profile/covertshores.bsky.social)*Thank you to an unnamed source. Any errors or incorrect assumptions are purely my responsibility however*   

 **Demystified**    
Since originally posting about this craft additional photos have been posted on a Russian internet site ([Forums.Airbase.ru](http://forums.airbase.ru/2016/10/t61261,20--opytovye-suda-2.2991.html) *(in Russian)*). The craft is confirmed to be the Carmon-18 (Кармон-18) from the CDB-Lazurit design bureau which was built in 1987 by Admiralty shipyards. It was a towed device operated until 1993 in order to test acoustic signature reduction techniques.
