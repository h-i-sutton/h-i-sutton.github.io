**The Chinese Navy’s Expansion Could Be Slowed By Coronavirus** [LINK](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hisutton/2020/03/16/the-chinese-navys-expansion-could-be-slowed-by-coronavirus/)  

Mar 16, 2020. China’s naval expansion seems unstoppable. But the ongoing coronavirus pandemic could slow the momentum.

**Cuba’s Garage-Built Navy** [LINK](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hisutton/2020/03/15/5-unique-weapons-of-cubas-garage-built-navy/)  

Mar 15, 2020. The Cuban Navy posses some of the most unusual naval vessels afloat. Since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 they have had to depend on their own shipbuilders, and like the vintage cars that Cuba is famous for, the resulting contraptions are quirky to say the least.

Mar 11, 2020. Back in 2006 North Korea announced that it had captured a foreign underwater spy drone. Its identity has been shrouded in mystery. Now with photo analysis we can say that it matches a little-known U.S. Navy type

**The Largest Submarine In The World Could Get Eclipsed** [LINK](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hisutton/2020/03/08/the-largest-submarine-in-the-world-could-get-eclipsed/)  

Mar 08, 2020. Russian engineers have proposed a massive submarine tanker capable of carrying 170,000-180,000 tons at a time. This would dwarf the mighty Typhoon Class ballistic missile sub, which is the largest submarine ever built.

Mar 04, 2020. A Saudi report of a failed drone boat attack on a tanker off Yemen appears to provide evidence of a new model developed by Houthi rebels based on a skiff that would be cheaper to build and potentially harder to identify.

Mar 03, 2020. Submarines are the hot asset among Asian navies right now, with almost every one acquiring new types. Yet by 2030 China could have more than twice as many as any other country in the region.

Mar 01, 2020. A tourist photo of Havana’s picturesque harbor improbably captured something of intelligence value. Lurking in the shadows near a pier was one of the world’s least photographed submarines. It's the first up-close view of Cuba's Delfin Class submarine.
