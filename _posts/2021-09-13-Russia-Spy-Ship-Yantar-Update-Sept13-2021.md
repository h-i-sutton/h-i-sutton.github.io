#BREAKING: Russian Spy Ship Yantar Enters English Channel![](/images/flag_russia.jpg) Controversial Russian 'research vessel' [Yantar](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2017-09-13-Yantar %}) has entered the English Channel heading northbound. It is currently south of the Lizard. The ship has turned on its AIS (automated Information System) so it is currently visible on AIS aggregators such as [MarineTraffic.com](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:1215053/mmsi:273546520/imo:7524419/vessel:YANTAR).  

Yantar is known for operating near undersea infrastructure including internet cables. It was recently seen [near internet cables off Ireland](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2021/08/russian-spy-ship-yantar-loitering-near-trans-atlantic-internet-cables/), but has been difficult to keep track of with Open Source intelligence (OSINT).
