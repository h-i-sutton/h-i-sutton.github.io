The Project 1910 *Kashalot* ('Sperm Whale') Class deep-submergence submarine (NATO: UNIFORM Class) program was initiated in 1972 under the famous Malachite design bureau. Construction of the first boat starting in 1977 with the first of three boats entering service in the 1980s. Designed for special'ocean engineering' missions it was analogous to the US Navy’s NR-1 which had been built in the 1960s. The Russian boat was significantly larger however, at about twice the length which made it, on paper, a full-size submarine. Under the outer hull however it was in fact incredibly small, with an inner hull diameter of about 6m which allowed for two decks. The hull was split into two distinct sections with the unmanned reactor compartment and machinery room in the stern, with no direct access from the crew compartment.

**Note**: the midget submarine direct equivalent of the NR-1 was the project 1851 *Nelma* (NATO: X-RAY Class) which was built in parallel to Kashalot.

Both hulls are made of welded titanium which is corrosion resistant and much stronger than steel for a given hull thickness. On Kashalot this translates into an incredible 1000m (3,000ft) operating depth.

*This close-up of the forward starboard thruster without the outer doors fitted (or retracted) clearly shows the universal joint at the bottom. The thrusters swing downwards on arms and can be steered to maintain a 'hovering' position above the seabed. The rubber acoustic tiles can be clearly seen thanks to the snow.*
