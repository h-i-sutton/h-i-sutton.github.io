#Naval Group Reveal XLUUV Demonstrator![Flag France](/images/flag_france.jpg) Described as an '**Oceanic Underwater Drone Demonstrator'**, French defense giant Naval Group's entry into the XLUUV arena is impressive. The innovative design uses sleek whale-like lines, reminiscent of the [SMX-31 concept]({% post_url 2018-11-13-SMX-31 %}).   

According to an [interview with Naval News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TVDx7huHI), the vessel was designed 2016-2018 as a Naval Group initiative. Construction was from 2018, leading to sea trials in November 2020. This places it on a similar overall timeline to the Royal Navy's Manta program. The project is not currently backed by the French Navy (Marine Nationale) however.

The craft can undertake ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) missions. For this it has a comparatively large sonar and a retractable telescopic optronic / radar mast. Missions could include close observation of a hostile coast to improve situational awareness of a mother ship.   

In future the craft could be fitted with a payload, such as torpedoes or nines. It could also be doubled in length, from ~10m long to ~20m, to increase endurance. This could involve more batteries, or AIP (air independent power). Naval Group has fuel cell AIP technology which logically could be scaled down to the XLUUV size.
