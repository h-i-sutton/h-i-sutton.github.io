![Flag](/images/flag_UEA.jpg) With its sleek wave-piercing hull and stealthy lines, the blisteringly quick WP-18 Tactical Strike Craft is the fastest naval vessel in the world. And possibly the most stylish Special Forces boat too. And it is not all good looks! Underneath the fully-enclosed composite exterior, the type boasts a spacious engine room and highly automated cockpit. The type is built by Abu Dhabi MAR.
