![](/images/Movie_theMechanic.jpg)The trailer Jason Statham’s new movie, **The Mechanic: Resurrection** came out a couple of days ago. Sandwiched between the predicable fast action, fast women, grumpy looks and explosions was a brief glimpse of an underwater scene. Statham’s character (I thought he always played himself??) is seen on a sleek black underwater chariot. More specifically, a **SeaBob** diver propulsion vehicle (DPV) which is the civilian version of the Rotinor **Divejet**.
