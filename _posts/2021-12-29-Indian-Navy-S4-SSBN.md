#Indian Navy's Third Ballistic Missile Submarine Doubles Missile Armament![Flag India](/images/flag_india.jpg) The quiet launch of India's 3rd Arihant Class ballistic missile submarine (SSBN), S-4 (as-yet unnamed), did not go unnoticed. Satellite images confirm that it is much longer than the first two boats of the class.   

Analysis of high resolution satellite images seen by me (I got them via OSINT, but I am unsure whether the satellite provider intended them to be public so I am not posting them here) suggests that it is about 20 meters longer overall. The forward hull, sail and stern appear, overall, largely unchanged. The hull diameter does not appear to have increased and the missile deck remains narrow. Taken together, this supports reports that the new submarine has 8 instead of 4 missile tubes. These will be arranged in a single row down the centerline.   

The newest boat may also have an improved reactor.
