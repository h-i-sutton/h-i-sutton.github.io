excerpt: Intelligence analysts are ticking-off warning signs that the world's smallest ballistic
  missile sub, the pocket-boomer UC3 Nautilus, is being readied for another test mission.
  She is hidden in plain view among the low profile sheds of Copenhagen's port facilities,
  midway between the Naval Base and the Sewage Works.<a href="/Worlds smallest ballistic

The submarine is reported to be just 17.7m long and can be equipped with a single rocket.

Recent satellite and aerial reconnaissance has revealed the test site. It is believed that the increased Russian air activity over the Baltic is an attempt to photograph this site:

The secret base is equipped with a large test stand, a tell-tale sign of rocket development:

This undated photograph, previously thought to show remains from the Roswell Fjord incident at Area-51, is now known to be in a hanger at the Cop-Subs site:![Area-51, Roswell Fjord](/images/Nautilus_museum.jpg)   

Attempts to keep the project secret have so far failed. Rocket tests out to sea have been widely reported in local media.

There are fears that the rocket could be combined with Sweden's MEATBALLS (MIRVs) to create a truly devastating weapon.
