**Tac Ops podcast with Covert Shores**[![](/images/Icon_Bluesky.jpg)](https://bsky.app/profile/covertshores.bsky.social)  
Submarine veteran and speaker, [Eric Moreno](https://twitter.com/KingNeptune767) has joined up with [Covert Cabal](https://twitter.com/CovertCabal) to produce a new pod cast.Was a pleasure to join Eric and Greg last week. The mammoth 1 hr 45 min session has been uploaded to youtube.   

We discussed the recent launch of the new Russian ‘super submarine’ [Belgorod]({% post_url 2019-10-18-Spy%20Subs%20-Project%2009852%20Belgorod %}), and the [Poseidon]({% post_url 2019-02-22-Poseidon_Torpedo %}) Inter-continental autonomous torpedo it will carry. And the [Harpsichord (Klavesin) AUV]({% post_url 2019-03-30-Harpsichord_AUV %}) and [Losharik]({% post_url 2021-07-18-Spy%20Sub%20-%20Project%2010831%20Losharik %}) deep-sea station. Will the Poseidon role contradict and compromise the seabed warfare mission and vice-versa?   

We talk about the US Navy’s [Orca]({% post_url 2019-10-20-USN_XLUUV %}) unmanned undersea vehicle (UUV) and NATO use of UUVs in Black Sea. And what about China?   

Also Swimmer Delivery Vehicles (SDVs) and the Russian Navy's [Piranha Class (LOSOS)]({% post_url 2017-11-24-Piranha%20Special%20Forces%20submarine %}) midget submarine.   

Film references start with Hunter Killer (sorry!) but quickly the book [Arctic Gambit](https://www.amazon.com/Arctic-Gambit-Jerry-Mitchell-Novel/dp/0765334925) (great) and the best submarine film ever.   

We also touch on why I draw my illustrations in [MS Paint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdKkR_lbLN0).
