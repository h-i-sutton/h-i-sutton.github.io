#New Images Of U.S. Navy's Next Attack Submarine, SSNX![Flag USA](/images/flag_USA.jpg) As is [becoming customary](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2023/04/u-s-navy-to-get-new-unique-submarine-virginia-ssw/), a comnpany video by an American submarine builder gives us the latest glimpse of future submarine projects. A video [published by Electric Boat](https://twitter.com/GDElectricBoat/status/1737564712827523529) shows two graphics of the U.S. Navy’s next generation SSNX boat.

SSNX will follow the successful Virginia class into service. It is expected to carry hypersonic missiles and refocus on submarine-submarine warfare. In some respects it is a return to the Seawolf Class ethos, just with land attack added. 

It is difficult to judge how representing the graphics are. Some design features are as expected, including the sail shape and x-form rudders with fixed leading elements. But other design choices appear trapped in the Virginia class. The vertical launch system ahead of the sail is retained even though it was something of a workaround in the first place. And the torpedo tubes appear few (perhaps only 4) and in the chin position shooting around the VLS and sonar. One might think that a new design, with modern conformal sonar, could relocate the torpedo tubes shooting forward.   

However, at the moment this visualization is the best we have. For sure the SNNX, whatever it looks like, will be a top tier underwater predator.
