Historical 'fiction' allows the author, former US Master Diver Robert G. Williscroft, to share the story of the most famous spy submarine mission of the Cold War. Williscroft's first hand experience as a Saturation Diver on USS Halibut during the Operations makes this work of *fiction* stand out as a historical source. Although the plot has elements of dramatisation, the historical and technical details are unparalleled, particularly in respect of the role divers played in these missions.

USS Halibut was tasked with locating and tapping the undersea cables used by the Soviets to communicate with their far flung nuclear submarine bases. The Soviets thought that these communications were completely secure so much of the transmissions were in the 'clear' (plain text or speech without encryption). What they hadn't factored in was that the US Navy had developed a way for divers to operate effectively at far greater depths and for much longer than they could have imagined. USS Halibut found the cable, settled over it and used the elite team of divers to plant and retrieve the bugs. An incredible true story which is the basis for many books, but none with anything like the details provided by Williscroft. For the serious history junkie, ignore the fiction label, read between the lines and enjoy!   

Highly recommended!
