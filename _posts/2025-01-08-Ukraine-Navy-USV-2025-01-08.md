Most get shot down thanks to Ukraine's innovative and effective air defenses against these low-end threats.

# First Daylight Look At Ukrainian Navy Maritime Drone With FPVs

![Flag Ukraine](/images/flag_ukraine.jpg) On January 6 Ukrainian Navy (VMS ZSU) USVs used FPV (first person view) drones to destroy 3 Russian air defense systems near Skadovs'k, north of Crimea. The attacks have continued with Russian social media reporting that, on Jan 8 a Ukrainian USVs with an MLRS was also recorded in the vicinity of Pokrovskoe and Pokrovka on the Kinburn Spit. They launched 10 rockets. These USVs were, circumstantially, likely a Sea Baby operated by the SBU. On the same day another USV, likely Navy operated, launched an FPV attack along the northern Crimean coast southwest of Armyansk.   

One of these latter USVs appears to have been damaged and washed up on the coast. Photographs of the wreck have appeared on Russian social media, giving us our first daylight wreck.

The wrecked example is damaged and incomplete, but a relatively tall mast is prominent. This appears to be for extended range control of FPV drones.  

On December 7 2024 the commander of the Ukrainian Navy (VMS ZSU), Vice-Admiral Oleksiy Neizhpapa, shared a video of a new surface drone (USV- uncrewed surface vessel) being used in the Black Sea. The vessel is unique among previously seen types in having a hangar for at least 4 quadrotor FPV drones. It also appears to have a hangar for minelaying over the transom.
