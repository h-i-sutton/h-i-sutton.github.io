# Timeline of Ukraine Invasion: War In The Black Sea

![Flag Russia](/images/flag_russia.jpg) ![Flag Ukraine](/images/flag_ukraine.jpg) Reflecting on the Russo-Ukraine War, I am putting together a timeline of the most relevant events in the Black Sea. This will not be exhaustive, but should provide a useful overview. Hopefully this will be of benefit to those interested in studying the war at a later date.  

If I have missed anything significant please let me know. The usual caveats apply  
  

## Build -up phase

Jan-Feb 2022: Russia builds up a force in the Mediterranean. Under Russian doctrine this is to counter the NATO presence there and deter intervention.   

Jan: Russia transports several Raptor assault boats from Baltic fleet to Black Sea via road. Candid video shared Jan 30.  

Feb 8-9: Six Russian warships enter the Black Sea as part of build up, transiting the Bosporus. Mainly landing ships and an Improved KILO class submarine.

Feb 15: Russia deploys Tu-22M3 BACKFIRE-C bombers and MiG-31K FOXHOUND fighter jets to Khmeimim in Syria. These are to threaten NATO warships in the Mediterranean. Russia reports that the Kinzhal hypersonic missile carried by the Mig-31K can attack aircraft carriers. The Tu-22M3s are observed with legacy AS-4 KITCHEN missiles.   

Feb: Russian Navy moves trained dolphin pens deployed to Sevastopol harbour entrance.  

## Early Invasion - The 3 Day War

Feb 24: Invasion begins.  

Feb 24. Russian Navy captures strategic island of Snake Island. The SLAVA Class cruiser Moskva plays a prominent role. Reputedly, the Ukrainian garrison replies to suggestions to surrender with “Russian Warship, go ?!?% yourself”.   

Feb 24: Russia declares a prohibition on navigation in the North-Western part of the Black Sea. Defined area down to the parallel 45-21 N, and from 0400 hours on 24 February 2022. Several third-country merchant ships were subsequently attacked, attributed to Russia. This blockade is total.   

Late Feb: Anti-invasion naval mines laid off northern Black Sea coast, likely by Ukraine. Possibly some by Russia.   

Feb 28: Bosporus closed to naval traffic. This prevents Russia transferring any of the remaining warships in the Mediterranean to the Black Sea. Russia had plans to send one, possibly two, more SLAVA class cruisers to Black Sea.  

Before March 3: Majority of Ukrainian Navy warships, captured, sunk or scuttled at onset of invasion. Notably, the scuttled vessels include the frigate Hetman Sahaidachny. Ukraine, whose fleet was massively out-gunned, is left with only a few smaller vessels.   

Feb-Mar: Russian Navy warships bombard Ukrainian coastline off Odesa.   

Feb-Mar: Russia performs multiple amphibious demonstrations where landing ships, supported by minesweepers and other warships, threaten amphibious landings near Odesa. The landings were considered a serious threat but ultimately never come.   

Mar 1: Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko revealed plans for an amphibious landing near Odesa in a televised security council meeting. The landings did not materialize.  

Mar 3: Ukrainian Navy Island-class patrol boat Sloviansk (P190) sunk by Russian aircraft in northwest Black Sea, reportedly with an AS-17 KRYPTON (Kh-31) missile.  

Mar 7: Reports that Ukraine hit and sunk a Russian patrol ship, Vasily Bykov, with rocket fire off Odesa. These reports subsequently shown to be incorrect, the first of several ‘*wishful sinkings*’.   

Mid-Mar: Russia starts removing the hull numbers from its warships in the Black Sea to frustrate attempts to gather intelligence on movements. This can be viewed as a sensible precaution taken late.   

March: Subsequent reports that the Russian frigate Admiral Essen was hit by a Neptune missile off Odesa. There were several 'wishful sinkings' at the time, however indications are that this occured. Missile did not hit cleanly, limited damage.  

Mar 22: Russian Raptor class assault boat hit by Ukrainian anti-tank missile near Mariupol.   

Mar 24: Russian Navy Alligator class landing ship Saratov hit while unloading at Berdyansk on Sea of Azov. Possibly hit by a Ukrainian ballistic missile. The ship explodes, damaging two Ropucha class landing ships which manage to escape. The ship sinks at the quay. Russia stops using the port for reinforcements.

Apr 7: Reported in Naval News that [SLAVA class cruiser Moskva is operating predictably](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2022/04/russias-most-powerful-warship-in-the-black-sea-is-operating-in-a-pattern/). Precursor of things to come.  

Apr 13. The SLAVA class cruiser Moskva, the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet and most powerful warship in the area, is hit by two Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship missiles. It sinks the next day.

## Post Moskva Sinking

Apr 21: “Sapphire” Ukrainian search and rescue vessel was returned to Ukraine following its capture on Feb 26, as part of the first prisoner of war exchange.  

May: Ukrainian engineers begin development of weaponized USVs (uncrewed surface vessels). The first type, the Magura V1, is tested over the summer.  

May: Fighting intensifies around Snake Island. Ukrainian TB2 drones play a major role, hitting two Raptor assault boats and sinking a landing craft at the jetty. Russian attempts to reinforce and supply it begin to appear more precarious. On at least one occassion Ukraine deploys a BM-27 Uragan MLRS on a barge to bombard the island.  

May 6: incorrect reports that Admiral Makarov was hit by missiles off Odesa. Subsequently not supported by evidence.   

May: Russia takes at least one captured Ukrainian Navy Gyurza-M gunboat into operational service. It was one of several captured vessels transferred from Sea of Azov to Novorossiysk that month.  

Late May: Harpoon and Brimstone missiles supplied to Ukraine. These threaten Russian Navy warships.   

Late May: Smaller Russian warships, including gunboats, involved in capture of Mariupol.   

Jun 10: Ukrainian Navy landing ship Yuri Olefirenko attacked by Russian rockets near Ochakiv. The ship, the largest remaining in the Ukrainian Navy, survives.  

Jun 17: Russian ship Vasiliy Bekh, carrying a SA-15 GAUNTLET (Tor) air-defense missile system, is sunk by Harpoon or Neptune missiles.   

Jun 20: Ukraine attacks Russian controlled gas platforms in mid-Black Sea with Harpoon or Neptune missiles. One platform still burning as-of Feb 2023.  

Jun 29: Two target barges, normally resident in the Russian naval base at Novorossiysk, were towed to Kerch. They are positioned as decoys to protect the bridge from attack.   

Jun 30: Russia abandons Snake Island.   

Jul: Threatened by Harpoon and Neptune, Russian ships largely withdraw from western side of northern Black Sea. This is a significant change in the balance.  

Jul 7: Ukrainian forces briefly land on Snake Island. Special Forces from 73rd Naval Special Purpose Center used underwater vehicles in this mission.  

Jul 27: Black Sea Grain Initiative (BSGI) agreed, effectively breaking the blockage of Odesa.   

## Ukraine Takes The Fight To Crimea

Jul 31: Ukrainian uncrewed air vehicle (UAV) attacks Russian Navy headquarters in Sevastopol. Russia cancels planned Navy Day events in the port.   

Aug 17: Commander of Russia's Black Sea Fleet (BSF), Admiral Igor Osipov, is removed from his post. His deputy, Viktor Sokolov, takes command.  

Aug 20: Follow-up Ukrainian uncrewed air vehicle (UAV) attack Russian Navy headquarters in Sevastopol.   

Aug 24: SLAVA Class cruiser Marshall Ustinov leaves Mediterranean, to return to Northern Fleet home. This leaves the Russian Navy weaker in the Mediterranean.  

Early Sep: Russian nuclear powered submarine, likely Severodvinsk, reported in Mediterranean. Seen as part of the outer defense for the Black Sea operations.   

Sep 8: Romanian Navy Musca-class minesweeper, *Lieutenant Dimitrie Nicolescu (29)*, damaged by a floating mine off Romanian coast. Romanian forces have neutralized several floating mines believed to have broken free from their moorings further north. Attribution unclear.  

Sep 21. Ukrainian 'Magura' explosive Uncrewed surface vessel (USV) washes up on beach outside Sevastopol. These are popularly called 'maritime drones'. Russian forces destroy it but otherwise do not appear to react to new threat.  

Sep 26: Nord Stream 1 & 2 pipelines sabotaged in Baltic. Attribution subject to debate.  

October 29. Major combined Ukrainian maritime drone (USV) and UAV attack on Sevastopol. Several USVs penetrate the harbour and two warships, the minesweeper Ivan Golubets and frigate Admiral Makarov, are hit by 'Magura' USVs. Neither ship is sunk. However Russia withdraws fleet into bases and starts initiating increased defenses.   

![Major Ukrainian USV and UAV attack on Sevastopol](/images/Russia-Ukraine-Maritime-Drones-attack.jpg)  
*Artist's impression of maritime drones attacking Sevastopol. H I Sutton.*  

Oct 8: Ukraine attacks Kerch Bridge, likely with truck bomb. Both roadway and railway connections broken. Repairs take months and in meantime Russian Navy landing ships increasingly used as transports.   

Oct: U.S. Supplied Combat Boats start to be delivered to Ukraine.   

Oct: Last remaining SLAVA Class cruiser Varyag and escorts left the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal. The ships arrived in Vladivostok in November.

Oct 26: Reports that Russia is attempting to reactivate legacy naval base at Balaklava, south of Sevastopol.   

Nov 18: Ukrainian USV attacks Novorossiysk. No significant damage but attack demonstrates range of vessels.   

## 2023

Jan 2023: Small Russian naval base at Feodosiya becomes more important with Kalibr armed Buyan-M corvettes using it.   

Jan 11: Russian warships and submarines based at Novorossiysk temporarily evacuated in face of perceived Ukrainian threat. Vessels return.   

Jan: Russia sows naval mines in Dnieper River near Kherson, seemingly to defend against Ukrainian river crossings.   

Early Feb: Space X, and its founder Elon Musk, say that they will stop Ukraine using their StarLink satellite communications system for long range drones. This may have prevented Ukraine using its explosive USVs near Crimea until an alternative can be found. Russian Navy increases activity of Crimea.   

Feb 10: Russia deploys its own explosive USVs, with one targeting the bridge at Zatoka, south of Odesa.   

![Russian maritime drone attacks bridge at Zatoka](/images/Russia-maritime-drone-attacks-Zatoka.jpg)  

Feb 28: Ukrainian UAV attack on oil facilities at port of Tuapse, north of Sochi. This is notable for its distance from Ukrainian controlled territory and strategic relevance. Russia deploys air defenses there, observed Mar 6.   

Mar 4: Russian war supplies continue to be shipped via Bosporus from Tartus to Novorossiysk. MV Sparta IV enters Black Sea.   

Mar 22: Ukrainian maritime drones (USVs) and aerial drones (UAVs) attack Sevastopol. Local reports suggest 3 USVs were destroyed. Video evidence suggests that at least one penetrated deep inside the protected harbor.   

Mar 22: Ukrainian forces reveal new model of maritime drone (USV)  

Mid-April: Russian forces remove privately owned boats in the occupied town of Heniches'k, Kherson Oblast, on the Sea of Azov. Unclear why.   

Apr 26: Ukraine reveals 'Toloka' family of uncrewed underwater vehicles. Production status unclear.   

May 24: Russian intelligence ship Ivan Khurs attacked by three Ukrainian maritime drones, in vicinity 41.883333°, 30.603611°. One almost makes contact but attack unsuccessful. Ship returns to Sevastopol.   

![Ukrainian maritime drone attack on Ivan Khurs](/images/Ukraine-attack-Ivan-Khurs.jpg)  

Early Jun: Russia increases dolphin pens in Sevastopol Harbor.  

Jun 11: Reports from Russian sources claiming that the Black Sea Fleet Vishnya class Intelligence Ship Priazovye, was attacked by several (possibly 6) maritime drones (USVs) in Southeast Black Sea. Later located to vicinity 43.064437°, 36.813334°. All USVs reported destroyed. Interestingly, they report that she was on duty "defending of TurkStream gas pipeline" 300km south-east of Sevastopol. Her claimed reason for being there may be significant and should not be taken at face value.  

Jun 18: Russian Sevastopol-designed 'Sargan' USV, which is similar to Ukraine's 'maritime drones', displayed at St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF).  

## Summer 2023 Counter-Offensives

Mid-late June: Russian Navy applies deceptive camouflage to warships in Black Sea.  

Jul 11: 2 Ropucha class landing ships used in a civilian role ferrying civilian traffic across the Kerch Strait. Continues after Kerch Bridge attack on July 17.

## Post-Black Sea Grain Initiative

Late-July: Repeated Russian missile and OWA-UAV attacks on Odesa and other Ukrainian controlled ports. High number of KITCHEN and STOOGE missiles noteworthy. Russia also suspected of sowing sea mines near shipping lanes to/from Odesa, possibly from fast jets using suitibly fused air-dropped bombs.  

Jul 25: Reportedly, Russian Navy Project 22160 patrol ship 'Sergey Kotov' is attacked by two Ukrainian USVs. Attack unsuccessful. Subsequently on July 26 the UK MoD update noted that the ship had been deployed to the southern Black Sea, patrolling the shipping lane between the Bosphorus and Odesa.  

Jul 28: Russian MoD prohibits small boats (pleasure boats, sailboats, inflatable boats, jet skis, wind surfers etc) from transiting Kerch Strait.

June 6: Ukrainian HUR Magura V5 USVs pass through/over boom defenses at Morskoy Spetsializirovannyy Port, Chernomorsk, and destroy the tug *Saturn* (Gousan-5).   

June 21: Russian sources report the downing of a Ka-29 HELIX-B helicopter while it was engaging Ukrainian USVs. Possibly shot down in red-on-red incident. Suggestion is that Ukraine launched UAVs which caused Russian air defenses to launch, thus engineering the outcome.   

July 3: Ukrainian HUR attack on Novorossiysk using Magura USVs.  

Julz 12: Imagery circulated on social media by 'Atesh' suggests Russian ROPUCHA and ALLIGATOR class landing Ships laid moored naval mines in approaches to Novorossiysk. Unclear what these are intended to defend against.

## Kursk Phase

Jul - Aug: Russia continues to repeatedly target Ukrainian ports and naval bases, scoring some hits.  

Aug 3: Ukraine hits already damaged Russian Navy Pr.636.3 Improved KILO Class submarine *Rostov-on-Don* (B-237) with an ATACMS in Sevastopol. In days after, a decoy submarine is added to the location. *Rostov-on-Don* likely still afloat but seriously damaged.  

Aug 9-10: Ukrainian USV struck gas platform MSP-17 (МСП-17) at 45.25826°, 31.6733°. Reportedly Russian forces had installed a GPS spoofing or jamming system on the rig. Afterwards the rig remained burning.  

Aug 14: Evidence that Russia deployed a decoy KILO Class submarine in Sevastopol next to the wreck of Rostov on Don which was destroyed previously. The decoy was deployed after the submarine was hit.  

Aug 16-17: Ukrainian raids on Crimea with USVs and missiles. Ferries at Kerch among the targets.   

Aug 22: Ukraine destroys Russian train ferry *Conro Trader* in the port of Kavkaz, Kerch Strait, with P-360 "Neptune" missile.  

Aug 23-24: Russia strikes Snake Island with 4 x AS-4 KITCHEN (X-22) missiles.   

Aug 29: Russian strike on Odesa destroyed Ukrainian Navy auxiliary A540 '*Chygirin*'.   

Sep 4-5: Ukrainian attack on Novorossiysk with USVs.  

Sep 11: Russian Su-30 FLANKER jet shot down by Ukrainian HUR with MANPADS east of line of gas platforms in NW Black Sea. The aircraft was highly likely engaged in attacks on the gas platforms with AS-15 KRYPTON missiles.  

Sep 11: Grain ship MV Aya hit by Russian AS-4 KITCHEN (X-22) missile in Black Sea, south of Snake Island in Romanian EEZ.   

Sep: Russian Navy practices evacuating Novorossiysk in response to Ukrainian air attack. Drills are carried out (at least) on Sep 11 and Sep 14. In the latter literally every ship in the naval port is evacuated.   

Sep: Missile attacks on Odesa have been continuing daily. On September 20 the merchant ship Golden Lion is damaged. Russian MoD implies that the ship was supplying arms to Ukraine (which I do not consider credible but mention for completeness). By October it appears likely that the attacks have shifted to include deliberately targeting merchant ships and civilian infrastructure.  

Sep: Russian defenses at Kerch Bridge being steadily increased.  

Sep-Oct: Iranian arms shipments to Ukraine via Caspian Sea highly likely to have included close range ballistic missiles (CRBM).   

Oct 7: Ukraine's HUR claim to have sabotaged the Russian Navy Pr.12700 Alexandrit Class minehunter *Aleksandr Obukhov* in Baltic. Propulsion reportedly damaged.  

Oct 7: Russian linked ship *Newnew Polar Bear* breaks the Balticconnector natural gas pipeline and telecommunication cables in the Baltic. This is seen as hybrid warfare by Russia in relation to the war in Ukraine.  

Oct 16: Russian MoD releases video showing captured Ukrainian HUR Magura USV being used as a training target for FPV drone crews.   

Mid Oct: Russia reportedly using Pacific Fleet LSTs to transport North Korean troops, destined for the war in Ukraine, from North Korea to Russian far east.  

Oct 21 or 22: Another gas platform in Black Sea (vicinity 45.34505, 31.86367) observed burning. Rig continues to burn afterwards.  

  

## Winter Of Discomfort

Nov 6: Ukrainian 'Foxbat' OWA-UAVs attack Russian naval base at Kaspiysk in Black Sea. One impact on the pier observed. 2 x GEPARD Class frigates reportedly lightly damaged in raid . Naval vessels dispersed to open water.  

![At least two Ukrainian 'Foxbat' OWA-UAVs attack Russian naval base in Caspian](/images/Ukraine-Russia-Strike-Kaspiysk-20241106.jpg)  
*2 screenshots of the same attack from different angles, showing a Ukrainian 'Foxbat' OWA-UAV appearing to narrowly miss the TARANTAL Class corvette R-101 Stupinets at Kaspiysk on Nov 6 2024.*  

Nov 17: Russian linked Chinese ship *Yi Peng 3* breaks the BCS East-West Interlink and C-Lion1 fibre-optic cables in the Baltic Sea. This is seen as hybrid warfare by Russia in relation to the war in Ukraine.  

Nov 28: Russia increases missile and drone raids on Ukraine reportedly targeting power infrastructure. On the Nov 28 raid 28 Kalibr cruise missiles are launched by the Black Sea Fleet. The number launched suggests 3 warships and 1 submarine involved.  

Dec 5-6: Sea Baby marine drones (USVs) operated by Ukraine's SBU attack Kerch bridge. Attack unsuccessful. Russian forces engage with helicopters, fast jets and assault boats. The Sea Baby's are seen with remote weapons stations (RWS) for the first time.  

Dec 6-7: Ukrainian Navy (VMS ZSU) USVs attack Russian positions on gas platforms in Black Sea. USVs launch FPV drones and lay explosive charges.  

![Ukrainian USVs](/images/Ukraine-Russia-USVs-Dec2024.jpg)  
*Left: Dec 5, Sea Baby USV engages a Russian FLANKER fighter with its onboard machine gun. Right: FPV drone's eye view of Ukrainian Navy USV as it lifts off to attack a gas platform in Black Sea, Dec 6.*  

Mid Dec: In Mediterranean, the fall of the Assad regime in Syria leads to Russia withdrawing troops and equipment from the country. The future of the Russian naval base at Tartus is in question. This distracts and disrupts logistics, placing strain on the Russian Navy.   

Dec 15: A gale in eastern Black Sea leads to 3 Russian vessels sinking or being written off. 2 tankers, Volgoneft 212 and Volgoneft 239 are lost resulting in approximately 3,700 tons of oil spill. A floating crane capsized off Yalta on Crimea's southern coast. The bad weather appears to have caused some of the barge defensive lines at the Kerch Bridge to break. The main boom defenses seem less affected.  

Dec 17: A third tanker, Volgoneft 109, experiences a similar emergency on the Sea of Azov side of Kerch, possibly sunk.   

Mid-Late Dec: Russian warships absent from port of Tartus, but remain off Syrian coast. 3 landing ships and 2 sealift vessels appear to be heading to Tartus to pick up remaining Russian Forces and equipment.  

Dec 23: Russian controlled (ex-Ukrainian) support ship Fedor Uryupin hit by Ukrainian OWA-UAV in Chernomorskoye, northern Crimea. Ship damaged.  

Dec 23: Russian government sealift ship *Ursa Major* suffered 3 explosions in engine room and sank in Western Mediterranean. Ship was carrying large port cranes with declared destination of Vladivostok. Likely the result of sabotage.  

Dec 25: Russian 'Shadow Fleet' tanker *Eagle S* damages the Estlink 2 power cable between Finland and Estonia. Together with the outwardly similar *Newnew Polar Bear* and *Yi Peng 3* incidents this is widely seen as confirmation of a deliberate hybrid warfare by Russia in relation to the war in Ukraine.  

Dec 26: Finnish authorities board Cook Island flagged tanker Eagle S (IMO: 9329760) on suspicion of deliberately attacking an undersea power cable connecting Finland and Estonia the previous day. Should be viewed in context of hybrid warfare.   

Dec 31: Ukrainian HUR Magura uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) down two helicopter with an AA-11 ARCHER 'Sea Dragon' missiles and damage a third. This is the first time in history that a USV has shot down an aircraft in combat.  

## 2025
