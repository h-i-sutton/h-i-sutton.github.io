**Cuba's swimmer delivery vehicle**  
![Flag](/images/flag_cuba.jpg) A new image has emerged which sheds light on the generally unknown Cuban Navy swimmer delivery vehicle (SDV).

The design, which was first revealed in a photograph in 2013 but has not attracted attention since, appears to be heavily influenced by the Italian built Cos.Mo.S Seehorse-II family of SDVs which were first built in the 1950s.

The Cuban Navy may have come into contact with these craft when some were supplied to Cuban dissidents via the US Navy.

The cargo vessel *Saturno* (MMSI 323000908, IMO 7908419) is 46 meters long and 10 meters across.![Russian Navy submarine outlook - Covert Shores](/images/Cuba_SDV_measured.jpg)  

It appears to be larger than the two-person Seehorse-II, being in fact longer than the four-person TRAS BX4 model (aka TRASS-III in US Navy service).
