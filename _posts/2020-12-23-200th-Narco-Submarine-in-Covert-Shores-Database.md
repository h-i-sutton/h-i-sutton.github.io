#200th 'Narco Submarine'On December 9 the Coast Guard Cutter **Active** (WMEC 618) interdicted a low-profile vessel (LPV) in the Eastern Pacific. It is [only reported now](https://www.dvidshub.net/image/6465759/coast-guard-cutter-active-interdicts-low-profile-vessel-eastern-pacific) that the cutter has returned from the deployment. Although the exact payload was not reported, we can deduce that it was in the region of 3 tons, about twice that of typical LPVs. This increase is part of a trend.

The vessel is a LPV-OM-VSV-8 (Low profile vessel, outboard motors, very slender vessel, 8th family).  

It is the 200th incident in my Covert Shores Narco Submarines database. The database is compiled from official press releases and local media reporting from across the Americas and, occasionally, elsewhere. If 200 hundred have been caught or found, then the true number is likely to be over a thousand.
