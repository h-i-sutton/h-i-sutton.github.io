#Old-School Narco Submarine Interdicted By Colombian NavyOn the morning of Sunday August 28 it was confirmed that a 'semi- submersible' (read: low profile vessel, LPV) had been interdicted by the Colombian Navy. It was sailing approximately 45 miles from Tumaco, to the south of Nariño. The seizure was aided by the air force and attorney general's office.

The LPV is an older style boat with internal motor. It is essentially similar to one stopped in February 8 in the same area. In the Covert Shores taxonomy it is an LPV-IM-10. This style of narco submarine can carry approximately twice the payload compared to the ones with outboard motors. However they have become less common in recent years, possibly as they are harder to build and source parts for.

The vessel was carrying 3.1 tonnes of cocaine, valued at USD 108 million by official sources. This compares with an estimated construction cost of USD 900k. According to Colombian Navy sources, the drugs belonged to the Western block 'Alfonso Cano'. This drug trafficking organization is commanded by a man using the alias Allende.
