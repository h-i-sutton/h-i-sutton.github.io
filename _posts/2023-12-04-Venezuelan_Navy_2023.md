# Venezuelan Navy Capabilities 2023

![](/images/flag_venz.jpg) Venezuela has [held a referendum](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/12/04/americas/venezuelans-approve-takeover-of-oil-rich-region-of-guyana-in-referendum/index.html) on whether to annex (read: invade) half of neighboring Guyana. The latter is a much smaller, lightly populated and minimally defended, jungle nation. It just happens to be sitting on a massive and largely untapped offshore oil deposit.  

Venezuela’s Navy has undergone significant change in recent years. Yet it is less well documented than many. This overview is not exhaustive, instead focusing on the most salient capabilities.  

The Venezuelan Navy (Bolivarian Navy of Venezuela) is a shadow of its former self. Years of economic challenges and sanctions have diminished its once impressive mid-tier fleet of frigates and submarines. Yet, with the help of Iran and its few allies, it has recently gained some new capabilities.  

Sanctions have left the Venezuelan Navy left improvising armaments. The degree of cottage industry is much less than Cuba, but still sees unusual retrofits such as 23mm Zu-23 cannons on Western built ships. Several ships have also been acquired by seizing boats accused of smuggling.   

The last remaining Italian supplied Lupo Class frigates, which entered service in the 1970s-80s, are of questionable serviceability. The main surface units are thus, at least in operational terms, three smaller Guaiquerí Class patrol ships. These may have been modified with [Chinese anti-ship missiles](https://news.usni.org/2020/10/16/china-arming-venezuelan-navy-with-anti-ship-missiles) although this is as-yet unconfirmed. The Coast Guard, which is part of the Navy, also plays a significant role and should not be viewed as an independent force.

*Although the Guaiquerí Class are relatively modern patrol ships, entering service in 2011, they have since been fitted with Soviet era Zu-23 crewed 23mm anti-aircraft cannons. One or more of these may also have been fitted with Chinese C-802A anti-ship missiles.*  

The Venezuelan Navy has not seem much action. On March 30 2020 a one of their patrol ships, ANBV Naiguata (GCG-23), scored a rare maritime kill. It [sunk itself](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-52151951) by ramming an ice hardened cruise ship, RCGS Resolute. The incident called into question the training and leadership of the navy. But at the same time it showed an increasingly aggressive stance.  

The Guyana Defence Force (GDF) by comparison barely have a navy to speak of. The Coast Guard, their naval element, has a few small patrol boats. Their largest boat, an ex-Royal Nagy minesweeper, is likely unserviceable. Even if it wasn’t, it wouldn’t be a match for the Venezuelan Navy.  

## Missile Boats Recently Acquired From Iran

In 2023 Venezuela received at least four Peykaap-III class missile boats from Iran. The design was originally North Korean but has been iteratively improved in Iran. They are armed with 2 x Kowsar or Nasr lightweight anti-ship missiles and 2 x lightweight anti-ship torpedoes. These boats represent a significant threat to merchant ships and any Guyanese government vessels.

The Peykaap-IIIs complement the older Vosper 37m fast attack craft (FAC) which are armed with the Italian Otomat anti-ship missile.

## Submarines?

On paper Venezuela has two German-built Type-209 submarines. These are the most potent anti-ship platforms in the navy except, like Lupo class frigates, they are not active. Possibly one of the Type-209s could be put to sea, but that's questionable.

**Type-209/1300 Specifications**  

Standard displacement: 1,390 tons (submerged)   

Length: 59.5 meters   

Beam: 6.2 meters   

Draft: 5.5 meters   

Operating depth: <500 meters   

Speed: 11 knots surface, 21.5 knots submerged   

Endurance: 50 days reported   

Crew: 33 standard, up to 38 in Venezuelan service   

Armament: 8 x 533mm (21") torpedo tubes with up to 14 SST-4 torpedoes  

However, the navy did acquire a submersible. The Italian designed VAS-525 mini-submarine is relatively deep diving, able to reach down 525 feet (160 meters). It was originally purchased for offshore oil industry but is now likely a navy asset. The platform could be used for intelligence (ISR), frogman attacks or seabed warfare.

## Amphibious Landings

The Venezuelan Navy has a modest amphibious assault capability. The backbone are four South Korean built Hood class landing ships (LSTs), and four smaller The Friars Class landing ships. These can transport recently acquired Chinese amphibious fighting vehicles and tanks.   

It would be reasonable to presume that Venezuela could pull off a small-scale amphibious landing. The ships can also be used for logistics and, to an extent, patrol.

The Venezuelan Navy also regularly practices riverine operations using both purpose built and improvised assault boats. These could operate from the coast inland down the Essequibo and Mazaruni Rivers.
