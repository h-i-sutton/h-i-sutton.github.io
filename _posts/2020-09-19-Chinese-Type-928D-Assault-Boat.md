**China's New Assault Boat: Type-928D**   
![](/images/flag_China.jpg) The Type-092D assault boat has been in the news because it has been deployed by China to [Pangong Lake on the China-India border](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2020/09/china-strengthens-inland-navy-on-indian-border/). Like most modern assault boats, the type is generally modelled on the Swedish CB-90 type.   

It differs from the CB-90 in three significant ways. a) It has a glass reinforced plastic hull instead of aluminum b) it is smaller and carries around half the troops and c) it has a remote weapon station.
