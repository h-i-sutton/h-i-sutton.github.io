#Candid Photo Of India's New Midget Submarine Under Construction![Flag](/images/flag_india.jpg) The new midget submarine being built by MDL (Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited) is visible in a photo of a VIP visit to the yard. The image was shared [on social media by MDL](https://twitter.com/MazagonDockLtd/status/1703731753285001236) and spotted by defense observer [Rethik5706 on Twitter (X)](https://twitter.com/RETHIK5706).

MDL is a Defence PSU shipyards under the Indian Ministry of Defence. It was known to be building a midget submarine as a technology demonstrator. In July MDL announced that it had successfully tested the submarine's hull in a land-based pressure testing facility. No further details of the submarine were shared however.

The delegation of 63rd NDC Naval Course visited MDL on September 18. They were shown the yard facilities, with media photos aboard a ship and in front of the shed where the midget submarine is under construction. From the image it is apparent that the new submarine will feature a traditional cruciform rudder arrangement and single screw. The hull appears, at first sight, to be a single-hull type.
