#Suspicious Super Go-Fast Boats Seen Loitering Off Taiwanese IslandTaiwanese media [has reported](https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/politics/breakingnews/3934396) that four boats were observed acting suspiciously near one of the county's small islands. The vessels can fairly be described as super-go fasts, with 6 (!!!) 400hp outboard motors, and are a type used by smugglers in the region.

*6 400hp Mercury outboards*  

Two boats were observed hiding close to the shore of Gaodeng Island (aka Gordon Island). The Taiwanese (Republic of China) territory is part of the Matsu Islands and only about 5 nautical miles from the Chinese mainland. Four boats were reported via other sources.  

The boats were observed by local fishing vessels between 0950 and 1130 on May 19. The two-person crews were wearing balaclavas but also life preservers. The boats appeared to be equipped with strobe lights and possible with buoys, also with lights.

##Chinese Smuggling BoatsThe boats photographed are remarkably similar to at least 10 examples seized by Hong Kong police.

*Over 20 similar seized speedboats seen at the Marine West Division Police base at Tai Lam, Hong Kong.*  

In previous times boats like these were used to smuggle luxury cars into mainland China. The classic example was the purpose built '[armored stealth boat](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2016-09-01-Armored%20Stealth%20Boat %})'. This seems less likely today but a large number of luxury goods are still smuggled in this way. Principle routes appear to be from Hong Kong to the mainland.
