Chinese defence firm Norinco has showcased its new UB1 ‘U**Sharp Shark-10**’ uncrewed surface vessel (USV) at the Abu Dhabi Maritime Defence Exhibition in the UAE. The vessel is broadly influenced by USV developments from the war in Ukraine, yet still has numerous indications of ‘big navy’ thinking.

At 12.5 meters long the design is slightly larger than comparable designs in Ukraine with a very wide beam. This allows for a remote weapon station (RWS) plus 6 vertical launch cells (likely for loitering munition type weapons) and two multirotor drone pads. It is unclear whether it is designed for a ram explosive charge, although likely not. 
The RWS can mount a 12.7/14.5mm machine gun, and with the electro-optical (EO) system. Stabilisation and (likely) AI assistance allows it to continuously lock onto high-speed incoming targets. 
A tall non-folding A-frame mast at the stern carries the EO ball, radar and other sensors and comms. Maximum speed is reported at 40 knots. 

Reporting in Chinese sources suggests that the Shark-10 ids intended as a node in inshore defensive networks. The inference is that it is a USV designed to hunt [other USVs](https://www.hisutton.com/Taiwan-USV-Kuaiqi.html).

*Several USV designs were on display at the show including this local type based on a jet ski hull.*
