# Ukraine's Sea Baby Maritime Drone (USV)

![Flag Ukraine](/images/flag_ukraine.jpg) The public first learnt of the now-famous **Sea Baby** surface drones when they were used on July 17 2023 to destroy a section of the Kerch Bridge. This attack was in itself impressive, but the small vessels have since shown themselves to be a versitile and enduring design.   

The Sea Baby is operated by Ukraine's SBU (Security Service of Ukraine). Although still small, the twin-engine design is slightly larger than the preceding **Magura V3** type, and the HUR's (Main Directorate of Intelligence) **Magura V5**. It can consequently carry a larger and more varied payload.

## Weapon Options

*Sea Baby USVs without weapons and sensor/comms fit.*  

In addition to the main charge, the Sea Baby can carry RPV-16 thermobaric rockets. Variations of two, four and six small rocket tubes have been seen. The rockets are unguided and have a range of around 1,000 meters. These weapons could serve several purposes. As well as being a primary way to attack a target, they could be used to defend against surface threats. During an attack with a ram-charge, the rockets could be launched to distract or suppress defenses. This latter tactic was used on some Imperial Japanese explosive boats in World War Two.

The Sea Baby can carry two Italian made MN-103 Manta bottom mines. These can be laid in depths of between 2.5 and 100 meters and target small to medium vessels. Their warhead is mid-sized, 150kg of TNT or 180kg HBX-3 explosives. Their fuses are acoustic and magnetic. On September 14 2023 the Russian Navy Pr.1239 BORA Class missile corvette Samum was reportedly damaged by Manta mines laid by Sea Baby and Mamai USVs.

Another configuration seen has involved 6 x 122mm 'Grad' artillery rockets. These have a range of around 20 km (depending on version and circumstances). It is unclear how accurate they are when launched from the Sea Baby.

The final configuration of note is a remote weapon station. Details are limited but footage has been shared of them engaging Russian helicopters and fast jets. A related 'Sea Baby II' vessel has been shown with a radar and a 14.5 mm KPVT machine gun.
