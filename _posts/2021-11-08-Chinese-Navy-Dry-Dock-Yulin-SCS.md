# OSINT: China Floods Mega Dry Dock For The First Time

![Flag China](/images/flag_China.jpg) The massive dry dock which China has [built as part of its Aircraft Carrier development](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2021/10/chinas-massive-new-aircraft-carrier-is-as-big-as-it-can-be/), has been flooded for the first time. Sentinel-2 satellite imagery showed signs on October 24 with reflections from shining through the cloud. This was likely while it was being flooded. By the next overpass, on November 3 it was flooded. And the latest imagery, uploaded today, shows it better (see above). This was picked up separately on by myself and [D-Atis (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/detresfa_)
