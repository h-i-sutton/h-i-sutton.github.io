#Taiwan's Surface Drone Threat Emerging - Kuaiqi USV![Flag](/images/flag_taiwan.jpg) Facing an ever increasing threat from the mainland, Taiwan (Republic of China, ROC) is racing to develop a similar uncrewed capabilities to Ukraine. Most visible of these in the naval sphere are weaponised uncrewed surface vessels (USVs), similar to Ukraine's Magura and Sea Baby types. One of the most promising homegrown designs is the Kuaiqi.  

The Kuaiqi USV has been developed by the Lungteh Shipbuilding Company. It was initially known as the 'Black Tide' during the June 2025 Taiwan National Chung Shan Institute of Science And Technology USV Demonstration. Few details are available in the public domain but the many photographs allow a basic understanding.

*Prototype 'Black Tide' being tested in June 2025.*  

A relatively straightforward USV closely analogous with the Ukrainian types and reflecting the latest developments in the Black Sea. It is a compact design but is noteworthy in the use of twin Cox diesel outboards instead of the smaller/lighter petrol (gasoline) types. Diesels trade improved reliability, safer fuel and alignment with military fuel standardisation, with cost and weight.  

At least three are being trailed, with a range of weapon configurations. As well as the ram-charge in the bow, it has been observed with hangars for quadrotor drones, and six launch tubes for the local Jing Feng loitering munition (similar to the Switchblade).

*Note the hangar for quadrotor drones amidships, still with plastic wrapping. This is similar to the arrangement used by Ukraine.*
