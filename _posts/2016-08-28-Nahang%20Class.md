![Flag](/images/flag_iran.jpg) After years out of sight, Iran’s sole indigenous Nahang (Whale) Class midget sub is confirmed still in service. The 24m (80ft) boat is visible in multiple sequential satellite images from Google Earth from Dec 2015 through to July 2016 at Bandar Abbas.

The Nahang was the end of a line of indigenous midget submarines built in Iran. It was eclipsed by the North Korean designed IS-120 GHADIR Class which has been built in large numbers (estimated 20), and is operated by both the IRGC-N and the Navy.
