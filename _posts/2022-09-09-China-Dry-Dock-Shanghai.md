#Chinese Navy Expansion: Yet Another Massive Dry Dock Takes Shape![Flag China](/images/flag_China.jpg) The rate of Chinese warship production is impressive by any standards. A new Google Earth satellite image update of shipyards in Shanghai emphasises this. But while many eyes are on the new Type-003 Fujian Class aircraft carrier, and destroyers / cruisers, there is something else nearby. The latest image shows solid progress on a massive dry dock.   

The dock, part of the Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard, is extremely large. More than large enough for an aircraft carrier. Provisional estimates, based on the visible retaining walls, put it at some 90 meters across and over 400 meters long. This is larger than another extremely large dry dock being [built for Chinese carriers](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2020/12/beijing-upgrading-naval-bases-to-strengthen-grip-on-south-china-sea/) on Hainan.

The cofferdam is in place and the walls are starting to take shape. In particular the wall at the end, which allows us to estimate the final dimensions.  

The [new yard](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2022/03/chinese-navy-growth-massive-expansion-of-important-shipyard/) will also have a large basin for ships to be fitted out. The construction halls, which are also taking shape, match the dry dock in scale. The yard is massive and is expected to be used for warship construction. Large amphibious warships are the safest bet currently based on Hudong-Zhonghua's current activities.
