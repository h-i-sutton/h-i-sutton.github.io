#Further Expansion Of China's Nuclear Submarine Shipyard![Flag China](/images/flag_China.jpg) In recent years China has been rapidly increasing its warship building capacity. This includes a major expansion of the Huludao (Bohai) shipyard on the Bohai Sea in northern China. Now a new harbor is being added, possibly to accommodate the increased production of nuclear submarines.  

The Bohai Sea is sovereign waters meaning that foreign submarines cannot operate there covertly without breaking international law. Therefore it is a protected space for the Chinese Navy to conduct trials of new submarines.   

Analysis of Open Source Intelligence shows that the new harbor started in early 2022. By June the harbor wall began to take shape but it has only easy to spot in recent months.   

The shipyard is currently as associated with the construction of Type-09IV (094) Jin Class ballistic missile submarines and Type-09III (093) Shang Class attack submarines. Future construction is expected to focus on improved Shang Class boats as well as next generation Type-09V (095) attack submarines and type-09VI ballistic missile submarines.
