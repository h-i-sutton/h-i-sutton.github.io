  ![Flag](/images/flag_sweden.jpg) ![Flag](/images/flag_UK.jpg) Following the latest trend in wet subs ('chariots') the Swedish 'Torpedo SEAL' is designed to fit into a regular 533mm torpedo tube to allow easy deployment from minimally modified submarines. Two Torpedo SEALs can be carried in a single torpedo tube. The type has enjoyed significant early sales and is promoted by British firm James Fisher Defence (JFD) as part of the *SEALPod* range together with the **SEALCarrier** submersible RIB and **SubSEAL** SDV.[Read More &gt;....](/Torpedo SEAL diver propulsion device.html "READ MORE")<br/><a href="/Torpedo SEAL diver propulsion device.html"><img src="/images/TorpSEAL_900.jpg"/></a>

![Flag](/images/flag_sweden.jpg) ![Flag](/images/flag_UK.jpg)Following the latest trend in wet subs ('chariots') the Swedish 'Torpedo SEAL' is designed to fit into a regular 533mm torpedo tube to allow easy deployment from minimally modified submarines. Two Torpedo SEALs can be carried in a single torpedo tube. The type has enjoyed significant early sales and is promoted by British firm James Fisher Defence (JFD) as part of the *SEALPod* range together with the **SEALCarrier** submersible RIB and **SubSEAL** SDV. In the export market its main competitors are the American Stidd DPD and German Rotinor BlackShadow730.

 **Early version**   
The original Swedish prototype, designed by Defense Consulting International AB (DCE), was a very compact 1 or 2 man craft with pop-up watershield and partial canopy for the occupant who crouched prone inside the torpedo-like fuselage. A telescopic 2-man version was essentially similar but with the second person laying prone behind the thrusters, also partially protected by a fuselage. The 1-man version had a length of 2.5m and the 2-man version 3.4m.

 **Current version**   
After DCE was acquired by British submarine manufacturer James Fisher Defence (JFD), the TorpedoSEAL received a revamp with a new open-topped fuselage and comms mast. Overall the concept remains the same but the craft has been matured and refined. The thrusters were also modified and now have two rather than three blades.
