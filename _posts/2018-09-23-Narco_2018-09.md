**Narcosub VSV intercepted**  
ElSalvador’s Navy and Police narcotics division intercepted a narcosub off Acajutla on 17th September 2018. The Low Profile Vessel (LPV) fits the ‘reduced cockpit Very Slender Vessel’ family which are identified by having a narrow single-person cockpit on the centerline right at the back of the boat, immediately in front of three outboard motors. The cockpits have a square-cut hatch with hinges at the back. The first example from this family was found on 28th April, since when two more were found. This example is therefore the forth intercept of this new family of LPVs (see [previous analysis](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2018-08-26-NarcoSub_08-2018 %})).

The craft only had three crew (all Colombian according to reports), and was only carrying 575 kg of cocaine, fitting the gradual trend towards lighter narcosub payloads despite a bumper cocaine harvest in Colombia.

**Narcosub found off Costa Rico**  
![Narcosub VSV - Covert Shores](/images/Narco2018_3.jpg)  
The converted speedboat Low Profile Vessel (LPV) was discovered 130 km off Costa Rica’s Pacific coast near Quepos on or around 3rd August 2018. The craft is outwardly similar to others in this family but is equipped with four rather than three outboard motors. It had a three-man crew and was carrying 2 tons of cocaine.
