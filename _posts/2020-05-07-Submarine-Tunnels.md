**Naval Tunnels to Hide & Protect Submarines**   

[![](/images/China-submarine-tunnels-Forbes.jpg)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hisutton/2020/05/05/chinese-navy-submarines-are-protected-by-underground-tunnels/)![Flag](/images/flag_sweden.jpg) ![Flag](/images/flag_China.jpg) ![Flag](/images/flag_chile.jpg) ![Flag](/images/flag_iran.jpg) ![Flag](/images/flag_nork.jpg) ![Flag](/images/flag_norway.jpg) ![Flag](/images/flag_spain.jpg) ![Flag](/images/flag_Turkey.jpg) There are a surprising number of tunnels built to protect submarines (and/or warships) from surprise attack. Today the main users are China, North Korea and,... Sweden. But there are many other examples around the world, sometimes disused, sometimes so secret that they remain unconfirmed.   

This is going to be a very lightweight guide. I've included coordinates so that you can go and explore yourself. Each set of tunnels has a story, often fascinating, but I cannot do them all justice so just sharing locations. Hopefully interesting!   

Submarines are at their most vulnerable while in port. A surprise attack could decimate a nation's submarine capability. In reality most navies have very few bases, and submarines are moored in predictable locations. But since the submarine pens build by the German Navy during World War Two, planners have turned to concrete and rock to protect their subs.

  

![Flag](/images/flag_sweden.jpg) **Muskö Naval Base, Sweden** 58° 59.090'N, 18° 3.269'E  

Probably the most extensive, and most famous, Muskö was inactivated after the Cold War. It has been announced that it will reopen however.

There are also a number of bases with on land tunnels for warships. These typically have a slipway with a turntable at the top, which rotates the vessels to enter/exit the tunnel. These are most likely for fast attack craft, but could be used for midget submarines. The best visual clue is the turntable. Example:
