# Russian Navy Warship Seen Off Odessa Identified

![Flag Russia](/images/flag_russia.jpg) The residents of Odessa awoke this morning to the sounds of shelling. Several videos are already circulating. Two warships are seen in some clips.   

Based on images shared online, I have been able to identify one of the ships as a Russian Navy frigate.   

The Russian ship is a Admiral Grigorovich class frigate. There are two of these in the Black Sea at this time, *Admiral Essen* and *Admiral Makarov*.

These frigates are armed with a mm gun for bombardment. They could conceivably also use their anti-submarine rocket launchers for firepower demonstration or limited anti-mine actions. One has been observed launching these rockets off the coast of Odessa earlier in the war.
