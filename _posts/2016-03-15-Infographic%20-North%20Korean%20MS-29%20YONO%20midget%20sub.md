![Flag](/images/flag_nork.jpg) Ever since the loss of a North Korean submarine was reported on [USNI News](http://news.usni.org/2016/03/11/u-s-official-north-korean-submarine-is-missing-presumed-sunk) I have been trying to find out which type of submarine it was. I don’t have a definite answer, but the rumors (‘RUMINT’ as someone called it!) all point to an MS-29 YONO Class midget submarine, the same class credited with sinking the ROKN corvette Cheonan on 26 March 2010.
