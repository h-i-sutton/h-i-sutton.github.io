![Flag](/images/flag_nork.jpg)Recent TV footage from North Korea’s suggests that the country’s sole **Sinpo Class** (aka **Gonae Class**) ballistic missile submarine (SSB) has relocated from the quayside at the factory where it was built, to an isolated peer at a submarine base. Analysis suggests that the new base is the major submarine base at *Cha'aho* (not on the island of *Mayang-do* as this post originally proposed).

The Sinpo Class is North Korea’s first ballistic missile submarine and the largest submarine ever built in the country. It is however very small for a ballistic missile boat and can only carry a single missile tube which is located below the sail. The NK-11 “북극성-1” (Pukgeukseong-1 = 'North Star-1' = 'Polaris-1') missile is a clone of the Soviet era R-27 missile and is consequently likely to be much shorter ranged than submarine launched ballistic missiles used by most other nuclear powers.
