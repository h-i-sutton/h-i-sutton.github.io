![Flag](/images/flag_russia.jpg) The Russian Ministry of Defense has shared photos from a recent exercise in Pacific. They show the a Project 18270 **BESTER** rescue submersible (DSRV – Deep Sea Rescue Vehicle) deploying from the rescue ship **Igor Belousov**. Also shown is a **British-built Saab SeaEye Tiger ROV** (Remotely Operated Vehicle).  

The same ship and BESTER DSRV *AC-40* was tested in the Baltic in 2015.

*The BESTER DSRV is launched and recovered from a hanger on the starboard side of the ship.*

*The British-built Tiger ROV can reach depths of 1,000 feet. Russia is also developing the indigenous Marlin-350 ROV design to supplement the imported Tiger (and other Western ROVs):*

*This appears to be a diving bell which can act as a rescue chamber if placed precisely over the stricken submarine.*

I speculate that the hatches under the cradle in the hangar may connect downwards to decompression chambers (*hyperbaric chambers*) to allow transfer of saturation divers and/or rescued submariners who may suffer decompression sickness if exposed immediately to atmospheric pressure.
