#Australian Navy May Be Looking At Nuclear Submarines![Flag Australia](/images/flag_aus.jpg) Rumors [have surfaced](https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/speculation-pm-will-announce-90b-french-submarine-deal-is-dead-20210915-p58rzo) that the US, and Britain, could be about to step in to help the Australian Navy realize a nuclear submarine capability. We may know whether this is true, and what it means, soon. In the meantime, these are the relevant submarines.   

Currently Australia is working with French builder Naval Group to build a non-nuclear version of the Barracuda type. Known as the Shortfin Barracuda during the competition phase (which it won), it is now known as the Attack Class. However the program has faced criticism, particularly in the Australian media.

The news that the US and UK may be working on an alternative deal may be a serious threat to the Attack Class program. I won't go into idle speculation, but there are some confusing aspects. And any decision is primarily political.
