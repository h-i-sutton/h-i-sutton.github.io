#Russia's BOSS Submarine Concept For Border Guards![Flag Russia](/images/flag_russia.jpg) Imagine a future where submarines prowl on the surface, launching aerial drones (UAVs) and engaging targets with gunfire and anti-tank missiles. It seems the antithesis of modern submarine operations.   

Yet Russia's famous design bureau Rubin has been suggesting exactly that. The twist: it's for border guard duties not regular combat. In Russia the border guard is part of the FSB.  

The BOSS (*Border and Offshore Submersible Sentry*) submarine is a concept which has been around for a few years. It is unlikely that Russia will ever build it, but it is all the same an interesting possibility.

*Feb 2022 design for BOSS Submarine*  

The [first iteration](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2021-04-12-Sentry-Submarine-Concept %}), also known as the Sentry Submarine, was unveiled in April 2021. This [second iteration](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2022/02/rubin-design-bureau-unveils-new-version-of-its-submersible-patrol-ship/) was revealed just before the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The second iteration is more modern looking but essentially similar.

*The first iteration of the design, note the more conventional bow and less blended lines.*  

The design is between 60 - 70 meters (197 - 230 feet) long depending on customer configuration, and displaces around 1,000 tons. It can carry up to 42 people including the boarding party. Two waterproof hangars in the stern allow for fast boats and UAVs (Uncrewed Air Vehicles). Launch of the UAVs would be automated. The Schiebel S-100 Camcopter UAV was previously acquired by Russia and is already used by the FSB, and local copies may also be available.   

An autocannon can be fitted in the sail for warning shots and enforcement. This is mounted in a trainable turret with the barrel depressing into a recess in the leading edge of the sail for underwater streamlining. Two pop-up quad launchers for Kornet anti-tank missiles are mounted on the forward casing. These have a range of about 10 km and are generally useful against merchant ships.  

In general however, this submarine would be foolish to engage armed boats with these weapons. Submarines are inherently vulnerable on the surface, and are also slow and unagile. The design is also equipped with four torpedo tubes mounted externally under the casing. These are likely for the MTT lightweight torpedo. Their use in the Border Guard scenario is questionable and they may instead hint at a secondary wartime role.  

The design is intended as multi-functional and can be used as patrol ships, and as rescue or research vessels as well. Equipment for the new ship comes mostly from surface ships and aircraft and is commercially available. In wartime it could be useful for ISR (Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) and seabed warfare. It could deploy special forces but it appears that the hangars are designed for surface use, which limits their usefulness in this later role.

While Russia could possibly purchase such a vessel for the FSB, it is also aimed at the export market. It is designed to be relatively inexpensive, making it affordable for smaller navies. Rubin suggests that it could be an inexpensive training vessel to give crews seagoing experience. This could also prepare the infrastructure before purchasing classical submarines. A bit like a starter-sub.  

Rubin consider the proposed submersible patrol ship combining the benefits of a submarine and a surface ship. Whether it's the best of both worlds, or the worst of both, is open to debate.
