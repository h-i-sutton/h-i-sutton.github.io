# Quick Comparison Between Korean KSS-III And ROMEO-Mod Class SSB Submarines

![Flag South Korea](/images/flag_nork.jpg) ![Flag DPRK](/images/flag_RoK.jpg) South Korea has test fired its Hyunmoo-4-4 ballistic missile from a KSS-III ( Dosan Ahn Changho class) submarine. The new weapon is potentially a game changer, especially as it is combined with a modern AIP-equipped launch platform. This quick comparison shows it next to North Korea's own ballistic missile submarine, the ROMEO-Mod Class.  

The South Korean boat is larger, more modern and generally more capable. It has fuel-cell AIP and future batches will have lithium-ion battery technology as well.  

However the ROMEO-Mod cannot be discounted. It's larger SLBMs likely have a greater range (tbc) and more significantly, could be armed with nuclear warheads. However the boat itself is outdated and the fitting of the missiles likely removed half its batteries. So it is very limited operationally.
