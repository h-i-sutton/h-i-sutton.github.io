#Attack On Russian Oil Facility Reveals Ukraine's Unreported Kamikaze Drone![Flag Ukraine](/images/flag_ukraine.jpg) The war in Ukraine makes it difficult to keep in the submarine and naval OSINT swimlane, so please forgive this brief off-topic article. Ukraine's successful [attack on the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/fire-broke-out-russias-novoshakhtinsk-oil-refinery-2022-06-22/), Rostov, occurred at 8:40am local time on June 22. Video of the attack clearly shows the drone involved.  

But it does not match any reported type in Ukrainian service.

The design is a typical single-propeller twin design. Ukraine operates two main types with this configuration, the indigenous PD-1 and Turkish made Bayraktar TB-2. Neither matches this drone however.

*The drone does not match the PD-1 (left) or TB-2.*  

Both the PD-1 ('People's drone') and TB-2 have an inverted V tail. The PD-1 also has noticeable winglets at the end of each wing. And the TB-2 has distinctive blended wing roots.   

The video imagery of the attack is, naturally, blurred. However it is clear that the new drone has a more basic tail configuration. There is a horizontal tailplane between the booms and two vertical tails, one on each boom. Possibly these are swept back slight and/or canted outward.

##AeroRozvidka Lviv? Or Chinese Commercial Drone?![Ukraine's Unreported Kamikaze Drone](/images/Ukraine--Drone-AeroRozvidka-Lviv-2015.jpg)  
*Drone demonstrated at AeroRozvidka Lviv in 2015*  

There was a drone with a similar overall configuration demonstrated with [AeroRozvidka Lviv](https://aerorozvidka.xyz/) in 2015. The design is small and can be hand launched. It is hard to judge, but it appears that the new drone is larger. However the resemblance is clear; whether or not it is a coincidence is not.

Some commentators, [including The War Zone](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/kamikaze-drones-strike-russian-oil-refinery-looks-like-model-sold-on-alibaba), have suggested that the drone is a modified off-the-shelf Chinese design. The best fit is the **Skyeye 5000mm** which is available on the Alibaba online market place.

Ukraine's use of drones provides a limited way to attack targets in Russian territory. An increasing variety are entering service with Ukrainian forces. Some are Western types, and some are locally modified civilian quad-rotor types. This unidentified type adds to the richness of this picture. As always, I hope to update this article when new information helps solve the mystery.
