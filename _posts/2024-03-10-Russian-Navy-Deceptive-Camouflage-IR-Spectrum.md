# Russian Navy's Deceptive Camouflage In Black Sea Not Effective Against Infrared

![Flag Russia](/images/flag_russia.jpg) The dramatic footage of the attack on the Russian warship Sergei Kotov on March 4 has a useful OSINT (open source intelligence) angle. Footage from the Ukrainian maritime drones (USVs) shows them approaching using an infrared camera. Meanwhile a nearby merchant ship videoed their approach using a regular modern digital camera. The ship has had deceptive camouflage added, meaning that parts are painted black in an attempt to break up its shape. The two sets of footage allow for a quick comparison.   

Some observers have speculated that the black paint may be intended to confuse drones or missiles using infrared sensors to locate and identify the targeted ship. This detects heat, and infrared absorbing paint is often black. The comparison suggests that this is not the case.  

The black painted bow and stern of the Project 22160 patrol ship Sergei Kotov are clearly visible in the regular digital camera footage. It is in itself impressive how good modern phone cameras are at night. In the infrared drone footage, released by Ukraine's GUR Group-13, the paint is not noticeable.

## Put Simply, It Is Just Black Paint

Since it was [first reported in June 2023](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2023/06/russian-navy-attempts-to-disguise-its-most-powerful-warship-in-black-sea/), I have suggested that it is likely intended for two purposes. Firstly to complicate satellite imagery analysis, particularly if using AI assistance or low-quality images, or in a rush. And secondly to confuse USV pilots while using low-light video feeds, or again if AI computer vision is used. Different ships are painted slightly inconsistently, with some emphasizing the sides, while others seem to emphasize the top. Thus both suggestions seem plausible. However the suggestion that it is for infrared stealth now seems much less likely.
