**World Submarine Rankings: Weapons Load**   

The more torpedoes and missiles a submarine carries, the more targets it can attack. There are many other variables at play (context is everything), but the maximum weapons load of a submarine is a real consideration. This ranking is compiled from my submarine database (see the Covert Shores recognition book [HERE](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1541392302)). I have calculated it based on total number of torpedo tubes (assuming that they can be used to carry a torpedo), plus the maximum number of torpedo racks in the torpedo room, plus any VLS or slanted lanch tubes.

The history and evolution of the torpedo room is really interesting. And generally not well understood by the general public. So it is worth a whole article in its own right,...  

The ranking assumes that every possible 'slot' is occupied. This is unrealistic in many cases but is the fairest way to compare them. I have assumed full-sized weapons, except in submarines specifically designed to carry a smaller weapon as part of their main arsenal (e.g. Swedish submarines using 400mm weapons). I have excluded mines carried externally.

>>>Get *The* essential guide to  **[World Submarines](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1541392302)**  
This **Covert Shores Recognition Guide**  Covers over 80 classes of submarines including all types currently in service with World Navies.

Finally, ballistic missile submarines (SSBN / SSB / SSBA) are excluded, as are a handful of special mission submarines (mostly unarmed anyway) and dedicated test submarines.

![Hai Shih (GUPPY-II) Class](/images/Hai-Shih-submarine.jpg)  

*The highest ranking non-nuclear submarine is also the oldest submarine in service in the world. Taiwan still operates two World War Two vintage US Navy Fleet Submarines as the Hai Shih class. They can carry 28 torpedoes and Harpoon missiles (sources vary).*

*The French Navy's new Suffren Class SSN can carry a theoretical maximum load of 24 torpedoes. This is significantly more than the preceding Rubis Class (14) but fewer than other Western or Russian SSNs.*  
  

11. Hai Shih (GUPPY-II) Class, United States. 10 + 18 + 0 = **28** *(Includes aft torpedo room, 24 & 26 also quoted)*   

12. Suffren Class, France. 4 + 20 + 0 = **24**   

12. VICTOR-III Class, Russia. 6 + 18 + 0 = **24**   

14. Collins Class, Australia. 6 + 16 + 0 = **22**   

14. Type-093A Shang-II, China. 6 + 16 + 0 = **22**   

14. Gotland Class, Sweden. 8 + 14 + 0 = **22** *(Includes 400mm weapons)*

![South Korea KSS-III Class submarine](/images/South-Korea-KSS-III-submarine.jpg)  

*South Korea's Dosan Ahn Changho Class (aka KSS-III) is the first modern non-nuclear submarine with a VLS for cruise missiles. Its internal weapons stowage is modest however.*   
  

![Gotland Class submarine](/images/Sweden-Gotland-submarine.jpg)  

*Although not large boats, Swedish submarines have a trick up their sleeve which results in high torpedo load-outs. They are designed to carry both regular 533mm heavyweight torpedoes and smaller 400mm weapons. The 400mm type can be carried and launched in tandem, thus doubling their number. (Saab photo)*   
  

24. Kilo Class, Russia. 6 + 12 + 0 = **18**   

24. Victoria (Upholder) Class, United Kingdom. 6 + 12 + 0 = **18**   

24. Scorpène Class, France. 6 + 12 + 0 = **18**   

24. Isaac Peral Class, Spain. 6 + 12 + 0 = **18**

31. Type 039A Yuan Class, China. 6 + 10 + 0 = **16** *(Est.)*   

31. Type-039 Song Class, China. 6 + 10 + 0 = **16** *(Est.)*   

31. Type-214 Class, Germany. 8 + 8 + 0 = **16**   

31. Type-218SG Class, Germany. 8 + 8 + 0 = **16**   

31. Agosta-90B Class, France. 4 + 12 + 0 = **16**

![Gotland Class submarine](/images/AIP_Kalvari.jpg)  

*The French Scorpene class design is typical of modern diesel-electric submarines with a maximum load of 18 weapons. 18 seems to be the sweet spot, at least for now.*   
  

45. Type-206 Class, Germany. 8 + 0 + 0 = **8**   

45. Kobben Class, Germany. 8 + 0 + 0 = **8**   

47. Fateh Class, Iran. 4 + 2 + 0 = **6** *(Est. possible reloads)*

*Some smaller submarines, such as the Iranian Fateh Class, have limited space for internal stowage of torpedoes. It is similar to the Cold War vintage German designed Type-206 and Kobben classes which had a lot of torpedo tubes but no reloads.*  
  

48. HDS-400, South Korea. 4 + 0 + 0 = **4** *(Likely includes smaller diameter weapons)*   

49. SX-756/K Class, Italy. 2 + 0 + 0 = **2**   

49. MG-110 Class, Italy. 2 + 0 + 0 = **2**   

49. Yugo Class, North Korea. 2 + 0 + 0 = **2**   

49. Sang-0 Class, North Korea. 2 + 0 + 0 = **2**   

49. Yono Class, North Korea. 2 + 0 + 0 = **2** *(Also Ghadir Class in Iran)*
