#OSINT: Hamas Diving Gear IdentificationThe rebreather type diving gear seen in images released by Hamas appear to match the Italian **SANOSUB rebreather**. Rebreathers are often preferred by military divers because they do not produce bubbles like typical civilian 'open circuit' scuba gear. However they are also available commercially. If the diving gear is from SANOSUB I would not rush to conclusions as to how Hamas acquired it.
