# Location of Tanker seized by Iranian IRGC In Strait Of Hormuz

![Flag](/images/flag_iran.jpg) ![Flag](/images/flag_RoK.jpg) A satellite overpass today has made it possible to provisionally identify the anchor location of the tanker seized by Iran on January 4. The South Korean **Hankuk Chemi** (IMO: 9232369) was boarded by the IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp) by small boat and helicopter. It was taken in toward the major naval base at Bandar Abbas.   

The ship is at 27.03639° N, 56.1701° E.   

The Sentinel-2 satellite imagery is relatively low resolution so a final ID is not practical. However, of the vessels anchored near Bandar Abbas this is the best fit. Additionally it is not far from where the British tanker **Stena Impero** was anchored after being seized.
