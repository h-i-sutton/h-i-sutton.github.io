#Philippines Design Indigenous Weaponised Uncrewed Surface Vessel (USV)![Flag China](/images/flag_Philippines.jpg) Facing increased aggression from China, the Philippines appears to have been looking to Ukraine for inspiration. Mindanao State University displayed a model of the Palid USV at the Philippine Navy's Self Reliance Defense Posture (SRDP) summit in Manila last week.   

The design is typical of the latest generation of combat USVs, leveraging StarLink SATCOMs for communication and control and an electro-optical system for target identification. The hull is relatively small, under 6 meters bey appearances, and contains 120 litres of fuel for a single outboard motor. The warhead appears to be from an aerial bomb rather than a purpose designed type.

People involved in the project have rightly pointed out that these small vessels will be very difficult to tell apart from civilian vessels. They could be used to target the propulsion to disable larger vessels.   

Like many such projects the future of the project is unclear, but the atmosphere seems optimistic that it can lead to a production craft. This capability is a no-brainer for Philippines, being both achievable and enhancing the country's ability to defend its waters.  

**Specifications** (provisional)  
Full weight: approx 650 kg   
Range: ~195 nautical miles (360 km)   
Endurance: up to 48 hours   
Payload: up to 150 kg. Warhead from aerial bomb or similar in hull with impact fuses.   
Max speed: 40 knots (74 km/h)   
Material: Carbon Fiber foam
