#Gone: Famous Chinese Shipyard Disappears![Flag China](/images/flag_China.jpg) For many years Chinese warships and submarines have been built at a shipyard in downtown Wuhan. The yard, on the Yangtze River defined the area. But as the urban environment developed, it seemed increasingly out of place.  

There were reports that the yard had been closed, replaced by a much [larger green-field site](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2021/02/china-increases-production-of-aip-submarines-with-massive-new-shipyard/) down river, the Wuchang Shipyard. So the appearance of a new submarine there in 2020 caused confusion among analysts. Was the yard going to remain open?   

There is now clear evidence that the yard has closed. The site has been leveled; it is no more.  

Before July 2021, and after, May 2022:

Many notable submarines have been built there. The Wuhan class cruise missile submarine, and te latest Type-039A-c Yuan Class.   

It seems likely that the site will be redeveloped as riverside residences.
