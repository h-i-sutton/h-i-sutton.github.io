**Russian ice-breaking submarine design**  
![](/images/flag_russia.jpg) Russia is building extensive seabed networks of both hydrocarbon extraction and defense related infrastructure in Arctic waters, including under the ice cap. Maintenance of these structures is hampered by storms and high seas, ice flows and ice cap. Surface ships are therefore sorely limited in application for several months of the year, leaving the seabed infrastructure vulnerable.   

In 2017 famous Russian submarine design bureau, Malachite, [patented](https://edrid.ru/rid/218.015.ff74.html) a special purpose submarine design for underwater technical works. In particular, the submarine is intended for the maintenance and repair of underwater mining complexes on the Arctic shelf. The submarine is also covered on their [website](http://www.malachite-spb.ru/223/).

Malachite is not the only Russian submarine Design Bureau hoping to cash-in on the arctic rush. Rubin has [proposed several designs](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2017-03-29-Russian_Arctic_Update %}), and even Lazurite (who have not had submarine orders since the Cold War!) have got [in on the game.](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2017-02-28-Unbuilt_Russian_Spy_Subs %})  

The malachite design is interesting because it features a unique ice-breaking bow and is completely ice-hardened, with fragile elements like the twin propellers (‘screws’) hidden in shrouds and further protected below a wider aft casing.

The large sail includes an integral hangar for a docked dry submersible, and there are three Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) interfaces; one under the keel, one on top of the bow and one in the port side. There is also a large grab-arm which fully retracts into the bow. Saturation divers are able to exit from the bottom of the submarine and are provided with an internal hyperbaric chamber for compression, living and decompression.
