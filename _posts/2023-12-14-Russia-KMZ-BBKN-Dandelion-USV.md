#New Russian USV to counter Ukraine's![Flag Russia](/images/flag_russia.jpg) Russian media is reporting that the country's first Ukrainian-style USV (uncrewed surface vessel) will soon be deployed to the Black Sea. The **BBKN Dandelion** (ББКН «Одуванчик») is a small USV developed by KMZ (Kingisepp Machine-Building Plant) in St. Petersburg. The latest image suggests a very different design to the RK-700 Vizir USVs previously marketed by the company.

Limited information is available. According to reports it can reach 80 km per hour (43 knots) and has a range of 200 m (108 NM). This would mean that it is shorter ranged than the Ukrainian types. Its payload of 600 kg is similar. Most probably this would be a warhead in the bow, although many options can be considered. However, these specifications are remarkably similar to those published for the RK-700 Vizir design. So a reporting error is a distinct possibility.

*KMZ's RK-700 Vizir USV for reference. This design is 7.5 meters long. The RK-700 leverages the RK-700 boat hull.*  

The most likely mission is to directly counter Ukraine's USVs.
