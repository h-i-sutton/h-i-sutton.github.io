**Russian Poseidon Intercontinental Nuclear-Powered Nuclear-Armed Autonomous Torpedo**  
2м39 '**Poseidon**' (Посейдон) / '**Status-6**' (Статус-6 / '**Skif**' (Скиф) seabed launched variant / NATO: **KANYON**  

![](/images/flag_russia.jpg) Poseidon is the largest torpedo ever developed in any country. At around 2 meters (6.5 ft) in diameter and over 20 meters (65 ft) long, it is approximately twice the size of submarine launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and thirty times the size of a regular ‘heavyweight’ torpedo.   

On 20th February 2019 Russian president Vladimir Putin [announced](http://tass.com/defense/1045598) that the first submarine slated to carry Poseidon would be launched in Spring 2019. This is most likely to refer to the [Pr.09852 Belgorod]({% post_url 2019-10-18-Spy%20Subs%20-Project%2009852%20Belgorod %}) which had been expected to be launched in 2018. The same day the Russian Ministry of Defense released a [video (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySZuRs3DxK4) of the Poseidon being tested.

**Official Russian Ministry of Defense footage seemingly taken aboard Sarov during a launch test of Poseidon, and released 20th Feb 2019. The mode of launch and markings on the object are broadly consistant with the image of the weapon painted for testing but differences are apparent (right-most image).*  

The weapon is viewed primarily as part of the nuclear deterrent acting as a *Second Strike* weapon hitting coastal populations centers like New York and Los Angeles. In this scenario its lack of reliance on satellites and the fact that it literally goes underneath missile defenses make it a slow but inevitable death. Critically this is a diversification of Russia’s nuclear deterrence and not a replacement for submarine launched missile; Russia is still planning to completely replace remaining older ballistic missile submarines with the new  [Borei-A](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2020-11-18-Borei-A %}) (NATO: DOLGORUKIY Class) boats.   

Russian official sources have repeatedly positioned it as a *multi-purpose system* with a tactical nuclear anti-ship role, shown striking carrier battle groups. Its usefulness against moving targets is less clear, but it must all the same be taken seriously. If anything this tactical-nuclear role makes countering this system more pressing since traditional /mutually assured destruction’ (MAD) is undermined.

Poseidon has been tested aboard the purpose-built [Project 20120 Sarov](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2019-02-22-SAROV-Class_Submarine %}) Class boat. When it enters service [in 2027](http://tass.ru/armiya-i-opk/5194368), it will be carried by two operational submarines; a) a modified OSCAR-II class boat, the [Project 09852 Belgorod](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2019-10-18-Spy%20Subs%20-Project%2009852%20Belgorod %}) and b) the purpose-built [Project 09851 Khabarovsk](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2015-11-20-Analysis%20-%20Russian%20Status-6%20aka%20KANYON%20nuclear%20deterrence%20and%20Pr%2009851%20submarine %}). Further deployment is likely to be on the as-yet unnamed Project 09853 Class being designed by Rubin.

As well as submarine launch, there are [reports](http://www.i-mash.ru/news/nov_otrasl/34798-skif-gotov-k-zavodskim-ispytanijam.html) and rumors that Poseidon has a seabed launch option, waiting on the sea floor for as long as necessary. In this mode the system may be known as **Skif** (Скиф – possibly named after the Scythian nomads who once Eurasian steppes 1500 years ago). It is unclear whether it will be deployed by Host Submarines (above) or surface vessels. In the latter case, the Pr. 20180 Class weapons ship ZVEZDOCHKA 600 is known to be involved in Poseidon testing and is a likely candidate for both laying and retrieving a seabed version. Due to the weight of the system (possibly 100 tons) deployment from surface vessels is likely to be simpler and more practical, but potentially exposes position of the launchers. The launchers also require a reliable and secure means of communicating with their base and a way of receiving the order to launch. The Pr.20180 has an ice-breaking bow allowing Arctic operations:

Deployment of nuclear weapons on the seabed beyond the 12-mile territorial limit contravenes the [Seabed Arms Control Treaty 1972](https://www.state.gov/t/isn/5187.htm) (formally: Treaty on the Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction on the Seabed and the Ocean Floor and in the Subsoil Thereof).

**Countering KANYON** [(main article)](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2018-08-15-Countering_Russian_Poseidon_Torpedo %})  
Although reliable specifications are illusive, indications are that Poseidon will go deeper and faster than current undersea direct threats. Therefore, countering this system will not be straightforward and will force Western planners to reconsider anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and undersea sensor/weapons investment.   

The last time that Russia deployed a weapon system that pushed the operating boundaries of undersea warfare, it took the US and UK about a quarter of a century to field key counter systems (*Ref. [Alfa Class](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2018-05-01-Alfa_Class_Submarine %})*). Development of the Poseidon has already been underway for nearly twenty years and deployment is reportedly planned within the next ten years, and yet Western observers have only recently started taking this weapon seriously.   

Currently, anti-submarine warfare is enjoying renewed focus after years of relative neglect after the end of the Cold War. While Poseidon will require a rethink of capabilities and priorities, many promising platforms and technologies are already emerging which could form parts of the solution.   

**Selected relevant technologies:**  
a) [![](/images/ACTUV_210.jpg)](/images/ACTUV.jpg)b) [![](/images/P8_MPA_h158.jpg)](/images/P8_MPA.jpg)c) [![](/images/Seatooth_210.jpg)](/images/Seatooth.jpg)d) [![](/images/Spearfish_210.jpg)](/images/Spearfish.jpg)  
  
>a) Persistent trailing of submarines by unmanned systems to provide quick-kill capability before launch. Picture shows Anti-Submarine Warfare Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV) program demonstrator.   
  
>b) Maritime Patrol Aircraft can deploy sensors (e.g. Sonarbuoys and Seatooth (see below)), torpedoes and depth charges to chase down the weapon after its launch. New lightweight torpedoes may be required to reach target depths. Shown is the appropriately named Boeing P-8 *Poseidon*.  
  
>c) WFS [Seathooth](http://www.wfs-tech.com/) subsea wireless technology may allow rapid deployment of persistent sea floor sensor networks (e.g. from aircraft) across the likely path of the weapon.  
  
>d) Deep diving long endurance torpedoes with greater autonomy. Current generations of US and UK torpedoes (Spearfish shown) offer a starting point for development, but tomorrow's torpedoes will be even deeper diving and feature long endurance with loiter modes, surface communications and possibly carriage of multiple smaller systems (e.g. Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) to act as a target-area sensor network, and/or lightweight torpedoes).  
  

  
**Open Source Analysis timeline**  
The OSINT trail starts with the special test submarine **B-90 Sarov**. Originally laid as an improved KILO Class submarine, she was heavily modified over a protracted construction cycle to serve as a special test submarine. She was commissioned in 2008. A key feature is a very large hangar-like weapons bay in the bow which is much larger than would be needed if she was only intended to test regular sized torpedoes. In the past the Russians had grafted additional test torpedo tubes onto the bows of old diesel-electric submarines – Sarov is a completely different beast and only makes sense in the context of Poseidon.   
![Poseidon Skif Status-6 KANYON - Covert Shores](/images/Sarov_ice.jpg)  

**Oct 2001 - 2007** Decision to complete the sole unfinished PL 877B submarine taken. New configuration re-designated Pr. 20120 in June 2003, and named B-90 Sarov on May 26th 2007.  

**24 Dec 2007** B-90 Sarov launched. Commissioned 7th Aug 2008. Initially B-90 Sarov was involved in testing regular torpedoes. The below photo, from 17th Oct. 2009 shows her being loaded with test torpedo in external tube, presumably in the hangar. The weapon appears to be 533mm or 650mm. Geolocated to 64°34'41.69"N, 64°34'41.69"N in Severodvinsk on the White Sea where Sarov is based.   
![Poseidon Skif Status-6 KANYON - Covert Shores](/images/KANYON_testtorp2009_1.jpg)  

**2008-9** Bow of B-90 Sarov extended, approximately 5 meters. New hangar hatch, and other subtle updates. This suggests that the size of Poseidon had increased during development:
