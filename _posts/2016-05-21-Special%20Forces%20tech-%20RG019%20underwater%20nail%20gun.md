![Flag](/images/flag_russia.jpg) The RG019 underwater nail gun was developed in the 1970s to allow Russian divers (Spetsnaz, GRU/KGB…) to fix explosives to steel, wood and concrete.   

The primary requirement was for noiseless attachment of mines to non-magnetic ships and structures where the typical magnets could not be used. Explosive nail drivers are incorporated into several limpet mine designs but the Russian approach was to carry an underwater nail gun instead. This approach is more versatile and allows for second-attempts, but requires carrying an extra device.

The RG019 formed part of a complex (system) known as 'Shot' and was designed by P.I. Serdyukov. It used *SS-1* 7.94-mm ammunition, and was fired at point blank into the target.   

Although the tool entered service in 1981, it is possible that it was rushed into limited service ahead of the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow.
