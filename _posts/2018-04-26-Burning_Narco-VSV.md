A Narco-VSV (Very Slender Vessel) has been intercepted by the US Navy. The Cyclone Class patrol boat USS Zephyr (PC 8), with a US Coast Guard detachment aboard, seized the vessel in the Eastern Pacific on 7th April 2018. The boat was ablaze, with the fire presumably started deliberately by the crew in a bid to destroy the evidence as Law Enforcement approached.

This is the fifth incident involving a VSV styled Narco Sub (see [Here]({% post_url 2018-03-09-NarcoSub_03-2018 %}) and [Here]({% post_url 2017-06-16-Narco-VSV %})). The layout is almost identical to previous vessels although it appears slightly less slender (length to width ratio) and the cockpit windows are less streamlined. The triple outboard motors and four-man crew are typical of this family of narcosubs.

The fire was extinguished and 1,080 lb of cocaine was removed before it sank:

Another narco sub was intercepted by US Coast Guard Cutter Bertholf on 3rd March, although it belongs to a separate family of craft. This non-VSV also has outboard motors, but has a comparatively high-running semi-planing hull.

Update: **Narco sub intercepted by Guatemalan Gov.**  
It was reported on 28th April 2018 that officers from the counter-narcotics unit (*Fiscalía de Delitos de Narcoactividad*) had intercepted a narcosub in the Eastern Pacific. The craft is a Low Profile Boat (LPV) with rear cockpit and outboard motors. It has some close similarities to the Narco-VSV family but a different cockpit.
