**Ukrainian Centaur Class armored assault boat**  
![Flag](/images/flag_ukraine.jpg) The new Project 58181 **Centaur Class** are a hybrid of Ukraine’s stereotypical Armored Artillery Boat concept and the Swedish Assault Boat concept. The type combines the armor and the firepower of the artillery boat with the high performance, robust build and bow ramp for troops of the assault boat. The resulting boat is much larger than other assault boats, but packs a formidable punch. They are designed to patrol rivers and coastal areas.

**Ukrainian armored artillery boats**  

#### 1. 2. 3.

1. In the 1990s Ukraine purchased four ex-Russian Project 1204 SHMEL Class river gun boats. These were decommissioned around 2008 but the type remains in service in Russia. Subsequent Ukrainian armored artillery boats are based conceptually on the Pr.1204.   
2. Six Project 58150 **Gyurza** armored artillery boats are in service with the Ukrainian Navy.  
3. Ukraine recently took delivery of two Project 58155 **Gyurza-M** armored artillery boats. A total of 20 are planned.
