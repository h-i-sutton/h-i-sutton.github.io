#Russia Deploys Unusual Decoys To Protect Strategic Bridge To Crimea![Flag Russia](/images/flag_russia.jpg) The Kerch Bridge, built by Russia to join Crimea to mainland Russia, is a strategic link. It is vital infrastructure for the war in other parts of Ukraine. And it makes Crimea much more defendable. So it is seen as a strategic target.   

Now Russia has deployed several countermeasures systems [to protect it](https://twitter.com/IntelCrab/status/1544010465000521728).

On around June 29 two target barges, normally resident in the naval base at Novorossiysk, were towed there. They have been moored on the east side of the main bridge, towards the Sea of Azov.   

These barges are covered in radar reflectors. In other circumstances they are used as a targets for the Black Sea Fleet. Now they appear to be used as radar decoys to confuse Ukrainian missiles.

A few days later on July 1 videos emerged on social media showing an aerosol dispersal. This covered parts of the bridge in thick white smoke. This blinded drivers and caused accidents. The aerosol had stopped by the time the satellites passed, so likely it was only a test.  

It is unclear exactly which types of attack Russia is expecting Ukraine to attempt. The bridge is far from Ukrainian controlled territory and they lack such long range weapons, except aircraft. And those would have to get around Russia's S-400 and S-300 missile systems.   

Other aspects of the defenses, possibly underwater, have yet to be confirmed.
