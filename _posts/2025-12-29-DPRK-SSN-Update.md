North Korea’s first nuclear submarine was initially revealed to the [public in March 2025](https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-nuclear-submarine-missiles-kim-us-183cde96a36844fdce559081551fc0a7). At the time only partial images of the hull were shared. Now new images, published on December 25, show the largely complete submarine. A much larger boat than previous indiginous designs, it bears some stylist similarities to South Korea’s KSS-III class, yet retains some perculiarities of the Hermit Kingdom's unique submarine heritage.

*Although the photos may have been retouched by North Korean state media, they are overall credible and likely reflect the overall form, plus many details, of the submarine.*

Reports indicate that the submarine has a displacement of 8,700 tons. Analysis of the images using reference points methods suggests a hull diameter of around 11 meters (36 ft), which is slightly less than my previous estimate of 12.5 meters (41 ft). Length is approximately 100 meters, possibly more. Overall this makes the boat around the same size as the Royal Navy’s Astute class SSN. The main difference of course is in armament.

The submarine is clearly, and as expected, a ballistic missile boat (SSBN). It appears to have a single row of 8 or 9 missiles mounted in a very large sail. This arrangement is typical of early Cold War Soviet SSB/SSBNs but it is not clear why, with such a large hull diameter, it is still needed. The missile silos are likely to be extremely long, up to almost 18 meters (59 ft) tall. This is much taller than the largest observed North Korean submarine launched ballistic missile, the Pykuksong-6 which is around 13 meters (43 ft).

*The fairing added to the lower hull is typical of flank-array sonars. It is comparatively large however and, oddly, there is no indication of the forward sonar dome under the bow.*

*Kim Jong Un, the leader of North Korea, inspecting the submarine. He is seen walking beside the port-side of the sail with one of the missile silo doors above. Note the gap between this and the hydroplanes, indicating a single row of missiles with alternating port-starboard doors.*
