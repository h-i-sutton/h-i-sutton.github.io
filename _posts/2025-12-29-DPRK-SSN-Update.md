North Korea’s first nuclear submarine was initially revealed to the public in March 2025. At the time only partial images of the hull were shared. Now new images, published on December 25, show the largely complete submarine. A much larger boat than previous indiginous designs, it bears some stylist similarities to South Korea’s KSS-III class, yet retains some perculiarities of the Hermit Kingdom's unique submarine heritage.

*The fairing added to the lower hull is typical of flank-array sonars. It is comparatively large however and, oddly, there is no indication of the forward sonar dome under the bow.*
