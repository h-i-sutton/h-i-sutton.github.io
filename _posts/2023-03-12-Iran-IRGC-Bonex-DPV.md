#Iran's IRGC Special Forces Using Modern German Underwater Vehicles![Flag Iran](/images/flag_iran.jpg) A recent parade of IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps) equipment in Bandar Abbas revealed some interesting gear. Mostly the parade showed of newly constructed boats including the [unique Zulfiqar class]({% post_url 2023-03-09-Iran-IRGC-Air-Defense-Fast-Boat %}) air defense fast boat. But hiding among some underwater vehicles, next to the [XLUUV demonstrator]({% post_url 2020-07-11-Iranian-XLUUV-submarine-drone %}), was something surprising. A small diver propulsion vehicle (DPV).

The DPV is a German [Bonex model]({% post_url 2016-01-29-Bonex%20DPVs%20as%20used%20by%20Kampfschwimmers %}). This is similar to those used by Germany's elite Kampfschwimmers.   

How Iran acquired modern western special forces gear is unclear. The same family of Bonex designs has also found its way into the [Russian Spetsnaz inventory]({% post_url 2023-02-27-Russian-Spetsnaz-Attack-Ukraine %}). The Iranian example was displayed on top of a military carry case, suggesting that it was not a civilian purchase.
