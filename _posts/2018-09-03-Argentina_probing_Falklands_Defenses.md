**Argentinean Navy Vessel approached Falklands Islands**  

  

![](/images/flag_Argentina.jpg) ![](/images/flag_UK.jpg) On 2nd September 2018 an Argentinean Naval vessel approached close to within the British territorial waters of the Falkland Islands. The vessel, ARA Puerto Deseado, appears to have turned off its AIS (Automated Identification System) as it approached Islands. A Royal Navy patrol boat, HMS Clyde (P257) headed south through Falkland Sound, apparently to meet the Argentinean ship although it stopped short of intercepting or trailing the vessel. The Argentinean vessel appears to have turned around, turning its AIS on again as it left the area. The Argentinean vessel appears to have remained in International waters.

At 08:42 local time on 20th August ARA Puerto Deseado (Q20) departed Ushuaia in southern Argentina (-54.8095° / -68.2835°) and was subsequently [reported](http://gacetamarinera.com.ar/nueva-campana-cientifica-a-bordo-del-buque-oceanografico-ara-puerto-deseado/) in the local press as starting a new scientific campaign in the Namuncurá Marine Protected Area / Burdwood Bank, which is 200 nautical miles west of the southern-most tip of Argentina and 100 nautical miles south of the Falkland Islands.

**HMS Clyde** (P257)  

A River Class offshore patrol vessel launched on 14 June 2006. The 2,000 ton vessel is equipped with a single 30 mm Oerlikon KCB cannon. The Royal Navy leases her from BAE Systems. She is permanently stationed in the Falkland Islands, with a rotating crew and local maintenance. More substantial maintenance is carried out in South Africa.

It may be the last sniff of action HMS Clydes sees; later this year she will be replaced by the brand new HMS Forth (P222).
