**Diving Museum** near Portsmouth, UK  
A unique museum of national/international significance. This is as close to the ‘official’ diving history museum as it is possible to get and I hope, perhaps naively, that it will enjoy a greater status in the future. Situated in a historic a beach-front fort overlooking the Isle of Wight, the [Diving Museum](https://www.divingmuseum.co.uk/) is run by the [Historical Diving Society](http://www.thehds.com/) charity.   

Many of the developments in diving, particularly in the 1800s, took place in Britain. So the museum has access to some important relics including the first ever practical diving helmets. And being near Portsmouth they have a significant collection related to the disappearance of LCdr Lionel ‘Buster’ Crabb, which happened nearby and is still one of the great mysteries of the Cold War. Most recently they installed the rare CDV-1 (Clearance Diver Vehicle) developed by the Royal Navy during the Cold War. A similar model was used by the SBS and christened SDV-1 (Swimmer Delivery Vehicle). Some basic information on the vehicle is [Here](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2016-11-12-Dick%20Tuson %}) and a more thorough write-up is planned.

The Historical Diving Society have also been a great help with my [Covert Shores book](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1533114870/) research and their archives are a treasure trove which I do not believe is rivalled anywhere for this topic. Several more articles will follow which will lean heavily on the HDS’ records.

**Other nearby museums**  
There are several other excellent museums nearby. The **Royal Navy Submarine Museum** ([Website](https://www.nmrn.org.uk/submarine-museum)) has an X-Craft, HMS Holland-1 and HMS Alliance on display as well as excellent collections. The volunteer guides on HMS Alliance are absolutely excellent, knowledgeable with first-hand experience and good at banter. Highly recommended.

Not far away the **Explosion! Museum of Naval Firepower** ([Website](https://www.nmrn.org.uk/our-museums/explosion-museum-naval-firepower)) has an excellent display of all manner of naval weapons including many quite recent items. The mines and torpedoes are of particular interest.
