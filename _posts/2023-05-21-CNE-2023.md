# Next Week: Combined Naval Event 2023

I will be talking at the Combined Naval Event in Farnborough, United Kingdom, next week. Two talks, one on Russian submarines, and the other on China's rapidly evolving submarine capabilities.   

The event is [run by Navy Leaders](https://www.navyleaders.com/cne-overview) and is pretty big with over 50 nations, over 200 companies and more than 1,500 attendees. It is the first time that they have co-located the three events; Surface Fleet Technology, Naval Damage Control , and Submarine Technology. I am mostly there for the submarines of course.   

Looking forward to many valuable meetings. If you are also there, say hi.
