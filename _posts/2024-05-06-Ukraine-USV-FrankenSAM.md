**UPDATED**  
#Ukrainian Magura USV armed With R-73/AA-11 ARCHER FrankenSAM![Flag Ukraine](/images/flag_ukraine.jpg) Footage has emerged, taken from the Russian side, of a Ukrainian uncrewed surface vessel (USV) armed with an improvised air-defense system. This is the first time anything like this has been observed. (UPDATE: The vessel was subsequently confirmed to be a Magura design used by GUR).  

The system uses repurposed air-air missiles in an arrangement often termed a 'FrankenSAM'. The USV was engaged by Russian helicopters.

The USV is armed with two AA-11 ARCHER (R-73) air-air missiles. They appear to be on their aircraft pylon rails but mounted upside down at a fixed elevation. This arrangement is simple and straightforward. The AA-11 is a late-Soviet dogfighting missile which is still used by both Ukraine and Russia today. It has an air-air range of 30-40km although theoretical surface to air range would be around half that. And the actual engagement ranges would be limited by onboard sensors, so likely much shorter. All the same it is likely generally effective as a surface to air missile.

Although the USV was successfully engaged by the helicopters, the underlying concept appears sound. And this may have an affect on Russian tactics. Until now the USVs had been almost defenseless against aircraft, and Russia has air superiority over much of the Black Sea. Despite that the USVs have been able to slip through and score a number of significant hits on Russian warships. But the addition of air defenses aboard some USVs may make them even harder for Russia to counter.

*The USV was eventually destroyed with gunfire from a Russian Ka-29TB HELIX-B helicopter.*
