#New Variant OF Neptune Cruise Missile Breaks Cover![Flag Ukraine](/images/flag_ukraine.jpg) Since the sinking of the Russian cruiser Moskva on April 13 2022, Ukraine's Neptune missile has become a household name. Its role has also evolved, from that of a pure anti-ship missile, to more of a long range cruise missile. In the latter role it is somewhat similar to the American AGM-84H SLAM-ER (Standoff Land Attack Missile) version of the Harpoon. The Neptune however has progressed through several variants, promising extended ranges of, it is claimed, around 1,000 km.   

The latest variant to be revealed, the RK-360L Neptune-D, features a significantly longer fuselage than the baseline R-360 Neptune model, with conspicuous enlarged fuel tanks ahead of the main wing. These saddle tanks appear to almost double the fuel load, assuming no reduction in warhead size.

*The RK-360L Neptune-D features distinctive enlarged fuel tanks.*   

Neptune is a direct development of the Soviet-era Zvezda Kh-35 (SS-N-25 SWITCHBLADE) anti-ship missile. The Ukrainian version was first announced in 2015 and entered limited service in 2019. Compared to its Cold War ancestor the new missile can be distinguished by larger less swept wings. Only small numbers were available at the start of the 2022 full-scale invasion and it was, until the Moskva, largely doubted and overlooked.

*The Neptune-MD land attack variant, with its longer forward fuselage, was often described in public sources as 'Long Neptune' until the later version was revealed. Note the launch booster behind the missile.*  

In August another extended range version, the ‘Long Neptune’, was shown for the first time. That variant was actually a more extreme rebuild with a larger diameter mid-section likely containing additional fuel. Range was also reported at around 1,000 km.

Neptunes have been used against a number of targets on Crimea and Russia. Together with long-range strike drones (OWA-UAVs) and other indigenous cruise missiles (notably the [extremely large FP-5 Flamingo](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2025-08-27-Ukrainian-FP-15-Flamingo-Cruise-Missile %})), they provide Ukraine with a way to strike high value targets deep inside Russia.
