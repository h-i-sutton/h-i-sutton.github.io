Until now, the underwater craft employed by the World’s Special Forces have been known only to a select few. Covert Shores is the first complete and documented insight into the little-known world of the mini-subs, Swimmer Delivery Vehicles (SDVs) and other underwater vehicles used by the U. S. Navy SEALs, Special Boat Service, Spetsnaz, COMSUBIN, Shayetet-13, Recce Commandos, Commando Hubert, Clearance Divers, Kampfschwimmers and many more.  

Operating under a blanket of secrecy, these craft have remained hidden and unrecorded in a way that no other class of military vehicles has. Covert Shores reveals the craft, units, missions and tactics of this unseen world. Spanning from 1776 to the present day, and covering activities in many countries including US, Great Britain, Italy, Israel, Russia, France, Germany, Yugoslavia and Sweden, this book is filled with tales of the ingenuity, resourcefulness, experimentation and cunning of those involved in the design and operations of these expert craft. A must-read for all military enthusiasts.  
  
274 pages 8.5"x11" full color with over 100 original color illustrations.  
   

>  **[Foreword by Larry Bond](http://www.larry-bond.com/)**.   

> There’s been a lot written about underwater special operations – some of it very good, but too much mixes fanciful tales or speculation with familiar history. To be fair, it can be hard for a writer to decide where fiction replaces fact, especially when some of the real-life actions seemed to come straight out of Hollywood. Also, countries and military services do their best to keep their covert military activities actually covert.  

> Thus, a detailed, broad, and objective history of naval special forces is both as welcome as it is unexpected. Mr. Sutton has collected and organized a comprehensive history that covers the men, the hardware, and the operations from the beginning to the present day.  

> The hardware is exotic. He makes the connection between underwater vehicles and other little-understood specialized craft such as military canoes, explosive boats and even paddleboards.   

> His descriptions of the special warfare units provide new details of their composition and methods, and also show just how interconnected the special warfare community is.  
A lot of the information in here is being published openly and unclassified for the first time. It is unique in subject matter, scope, and accuracy.  

> This second edition demonstrates Mr. Sutton’s efforts to keep up with current developments in a difficult subject. Luckily, he is both familiar with the topic and a good researcher. He's also a fine illustrator, with many excellent drawings and graphics to support the text. That means he gets all the credit for a valuable addition to naval literature.
