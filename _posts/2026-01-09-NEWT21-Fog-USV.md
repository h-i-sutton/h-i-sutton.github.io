![Flag Ukraine](/images/flag_ukraine.jpg) ![Flag Lavia](/images/flag_latvia.jpg) Ukraine has received the **Fog** surface drone (USV) from Latvian firm NEWT21. The small vessel is intended primarily for patrolling and surveillance, search and rescue missions, and has a offensive possibility. It is marketed for both sea and riverine use, and both offensive and defensive missions. 


Fitted with a wide range of sensors it can perform autonomous reconnaissance, and both surface and underwater surveillance. Its payload is quite modest but it could be used in the anti-ship role per the Ukrainian Magura and Sea Baby types. 


The craft has similar overall dimensions to the classic Ukrainian Magura V5 USV, but is somewhat smaller due to the narrower beam of the carbonfibre hull. Large wing-like sponsons at the stern give it a similar overall bream to the Magura however.
