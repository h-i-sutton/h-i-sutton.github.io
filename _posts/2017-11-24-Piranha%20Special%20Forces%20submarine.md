The type was designed at the famous Malachite design bureau by Chief designer Chief Designer L.V.Chernopyatov in the 1970s and entered limited service in the late 1980s. Of classic Soviet double-hull construction, the inner hulls were built from Titanium. After protracted development the two units built were in and out of service during the 1990s.

Victims of the defense cuts of the 1990s, both hulls were decommissioned and scrapped:

*As well as Sirena SDVs, the payload tubes could accommodate four Proton Diver Propulsion Vehicles (DPVs)*.   

 **Successor designs**   
  
**Piranha-T** - small attack submarine variant with mix of 533mm and 400mm torpedo tubes. Limited diver capability (possibly exit via torpedo tubes).

**U-130** - smaller dual-role attack and special forces submarine. Retains diver lock-out chamber with moon pool

**Piranha-2** - updated special forces submarine. Extended hull may allow AIP (air-independent propulsion). Appears to sacrifice 533mm torpedo tubes for 400mm which would preclude the Sirena-UME SDV and some DPVs
