# Rare Fully-Submersible Narco Submarine Captured In ColombiaThe Colombian Navy has captured yet another narco-submarine on November 5, but this one was unusual. This one appears to be fully submersible (FSV - Fully submersible Vessel). Early indications are that it is a fully-electric device. It may have been intended to be towed some of the way.

The vessel was found near the Cucurrupí River in the Chocó area of Colombia. It was part of a larger operation in coordination with the DEA and law enforcement. 11 suspected drug traffickers were arrested for extradition to the US.

The craft has a cylindrical form with a circular hatch on the top. Together with the hydroplanes visible in the images this strongly suggests a fully-submersible vessel. It is made of glass reinforced plastic (GRP) or similar, so lit is likely very limited in diving depth. The Colombian Navy estimate that it could carry 6 tons of narcotics.

This latest vessel is reminiscent of the 2017 'Choco Submarine' (left) and the uncrewed towed narco torpedoes(right). Where it differs significantly is in the user of fiberglass instead of steel.
