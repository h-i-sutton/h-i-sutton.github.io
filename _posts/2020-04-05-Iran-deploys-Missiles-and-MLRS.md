**Iran deploys MLRS and anti-ship missiles to Strait of Hormuz**  
![Flag](/images/flag_iran.jpg) Videos are emerging of Iranian rocket and missile systems lined up along beaches. They are apparently deployed to cover the Strait of Hormuz. One video says that it was taken on Qeshm Island overlooking strait of Hormuz. The videos appear credible.   

Although the videos are blurred, they appear to show an assortment of systems. One [video (on Twitter)](https://twitter.com/MrPrismakov/status/1246709667469963267) shows Fajr-5 and Fajr-3 MLRS as well as a single Khatam-5 anti-ship missile launcher. The [other (on Twitter)](https://twitter.com/Souria4Syrians/status/1246328702348165121) appears to show a battery of at least four Fajr-5 MLRS.
