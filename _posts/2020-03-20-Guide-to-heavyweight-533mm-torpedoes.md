This article will cover contemporary heavyweight (533mm / 21") torpedoes. It will be extensive but not necessarily exhaustive. If you do not see the torpedo you are looking for, please try back at a later date.   

##Mk-48 ADCAP, US![Flag](/images/flag_USA.jpg) The Mk-48 was one of the first western torpedoes designed to counter extra-fast deep diving submarines such as the Alfa Class. It was also designed to operate under the ice cap and, generally, in a wider envelope than most torpedoes. As torpedoes generally improve, the Mk-48 stays in the top tier with the upgraded ADCAP (Advanced Capability) version. This has improved situational awareness.

*Comparison of original Mk48 (left) and the ADCAP (right)*  

##Spearfish, UK![Flag](/images/flag_UK.jpg) Generally on a par with the US Navy's Mk-48 ADCAP, the Spearfish was designed to tackle similar Russian (then Soviet) high-performance submarines. The two weapons have their own pros and cons.   
![World Heavyweight Torpedoes - Covert shores](/images/Torpedo-Royal-Navy-Spearfish.jpg)  
A prototype of the next-generation Spearfish Mod-1 has been tested. The Mod-1 incorporates a single-fuel thermal motor and an insensitive warhead to improve safety.

An export model has been marketed as Torpedo 2000 but is now referred to by Saab simply as the Heavyweight Torpedo (HWT).

##Black Shark Advanced (BSA), Italy![Flag](/images/flag_italy.jpg) The Black Shark Advanced (Nuovo Siluro Pesante) is a new future torpedo for the Italian Navy's Type 212 Todaro-class submarines.   

An interesting feature is that the rechargable batteries can be optimized for training as well as combat. This allows them to be launched many more times in training up to 100 times. Generally, the more test launches during training, the better the success rate should be.   
![World Heavyweight Torpedoes - Covert shores](/images/Torpedo-Italy-Black-Shark-Advanced.jpg)

##Tiger Shark, South Korea![Flag](/images/flag_RoK.jpg) The new heavyweight torpedo, reportedly named Tiger Shark, is LIG Nex1's follow-up to their current White Shark ( K731 Baek Sang Eo) type. Unlike the earlier model it is wire guided and uses lithium-ion battery technology. The project has been de-risked by leveraging research and development for the Blue Shark (K745 Chung Sang Eo) lightweight torpedo. Service entry is expected in 2020.

It can however be effective. It is best known as the torpedo used by a North Korean MS-29 Yono Class midget submarine to sink a South Korean corvette. On March 26 2010 the ROKS Cheonan was broken in half by a single explosion under its keel.
