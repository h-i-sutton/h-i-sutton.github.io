**Russian Special Mission Host Submarine**  

The BS-64 ‘Moscow’ (*Podmoskovye*) left the Zvezdochka repair center on 22nd October and was reported undergoing sea trials on 24th October near Arkhangelsk. The converted ballistic missile submarine is now a special mission boat which will act as a host submarine for smaller nuclear powered deep diving submarines like LOSHARIK. It is probable that she will be involved in the deployment of a Russian sensor network under the Arctic ice cap (see SHELF). She will complement the converted OSCAR-II submarine *Belgorod* which is still undergoing conversion.

BS-64’s conversion involved the removal of the distinctive ‘whale back’ missile section which allows a much flatter back. Beneath the hull there is a docking position for a special mission midget submarine.

**USCG Intercepted Narco Sub**

A video has emerged of crewmen from the US Coast Guard Cutter *Waesche* intercepting and bailing out a narco-sub in the Pacific on 6th September. Unlike some other recent captures ([HERE >....](/Hybrid Narcosub.html "HERE")) which are of a new type of hybrid go-fast boat, this narcosub was a typical single-engine fiberglass ‘Low Profile Vessel’ (LPV) which is termed a Self-Propelled Semi-Submersible (SPSS) by US forces. The vessel was carrying 5,600lb of cocaine.

**Russian frogmen in the news**  

Popular Mechanics has run an interesting article reporting that Russian media has showcased the APS underwater rifle in a news item relating to the Baltic Fleet. The news item is taken as a message to NATO that Russian frogmen are ready to react to any special forces combat swimmer operations.

**Project 20386 'LCSki'**  

![Project 20386 ](/images/20386E.jpg)  

Covert Shores does not normally cover surface combatants but Russia’s answer to the LCS is quite interesting. A ceremony in St. Petersburg earlier today celebrated the start of construction of a Project 20386 ‘Defiant’ corvette. The ship will be 109m long, 13m wide and displace 3,400 tons, making it similar in size to the US Navy’s Freedom class LCS. It is intended to enter service in 2021.  

![Project 20386 ](/images/20386_hld.jpg)  

Many would challenge likening the Russian Corvette with the LCS program. There are some major differences in how the design is intended to function. Fundamentally the Defiant Class is intended as a general purpose corvette or light frigate with bow sonar and ASW helicopter as standard. Additionally it is equipped with air defense systems and *Kalibr* cruise missiles as standard. And it trades speed for this inbuilt general purpose capability, making it a very different boat to the USN’s LCS designs. However, it also borrows much from the LCS including an integral boat hangar in the stern with plenty of space for mission specific modules.
