She was spotted moved from her usual berth, where she has been since being launched in April 2019, by [Twitter user @OSINT_1](https://twitter.com/OSINT_1). Analysis of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery shows that she moved between 25th and 29th April. As-of 29th she was still in the floating dock used to transfer vessels to the construction halls.
