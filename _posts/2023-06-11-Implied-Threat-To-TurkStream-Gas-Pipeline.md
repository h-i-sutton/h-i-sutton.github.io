#Spy Ship Attacked: Russia Implies Ukrainian/NATO Threat To TurkStream Gas Pipeline![Flag Russia](/images/flag_russia.jpg) ![Flag Ukraine](/images/flag_ukraine.jpg) There are reports from Russian sources claiming that the Black Sea Fleet Vishnya class Intelligence Ship Priazovye, was attacked by maritime drones (USVs). This happened in the Southeast Black Sea, in a similar area to where Russian intelligence ship Ivan Khurs attacked on May 24.   

From a defense analysis the attack is interesting, although all USVs (reportedly 6) are said to have been destroyed. However the claimed reason that she was there may be more significant.

*Russia released footage of drones being destroyed. These seemed credible although details are unclear.*  

It is generally expected that Russian intelligence ships operating in this area, away from Ukrainian controlled coasts, are there to monitor NATO air assets. However the Russian reports claim a different purpose. She was apparently "defending of Turk stream gas pipeline" (and/or Blue Stream) 300km southeast of Sevastopol. Vishnya class intelligence ships are not well suited to protecting undersea infrastructure.

*Sketch map of the Turk Steam pipeline.*  

The TurkStream pipeline is controversial because, like Nord Stream, it is seen as a way Russia can pipe gas to Europe without going via Ukraine. It also offers Turkey the potential to 'whitewash' Russian gas to obscure its origin. It is operated by Gazprom (Russian onshore section, offshore section) and BOTAŞ (Turkish onshore section)  

The inference is that Russia believes that it needs to defend the pipeline. Possibly from Ukrainian or NATO sabotage. This seems far-fetched.   

##This may indicate Russia trying to frame Ukraine for an as-yet unrealized attack on the pipeline.   
Naturally this claim needs to be considered against the backdrop of the September 26 2022 attack on the NordStream Pipeline in the Baltic. Although various theories have emerged, some more plausible than others, the main evidence based one is that Russia did it. Russian Navy [ships were observed](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65461401) by various means operating suspiciously over the pipes in the lead-up to the attack.   

The southern half of the Black Sea where the pipeline runs is very deep, far beyond what would be feasible to non-state actors or countries without specialist capabilities.   

Russia has variously claimed that Britain and America were responsible. Although oddly Russian Government sources also dismissed claims that Ukraine was behind it. Now the straightforward interstation is that Ukraine is a threat to another Russian linked pipeline. Consistency is however not a requirement in information warfare.   

This pattern may indicate Russia trying to frame Ukraine for an as-yet unrealized attack on the TurkStream pipeline.
