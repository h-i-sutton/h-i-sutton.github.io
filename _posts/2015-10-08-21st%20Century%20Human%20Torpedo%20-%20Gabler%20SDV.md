![](/images/flag_germany.jpg) Dubbed the **Sea Devil** and 'Unterwasserschwimmhilfe' (underwater swimmers' float), Gabler's two-man SDV (Swimmer Delivery Vehicle) is a unique reintrepration of the Human Torpedo concept. It is closest to the Russian *Sirena* series of SDVs, although a closer comparison might be the Swedish (/British) *Torpedo-SEAL* DPV. Designed to fit within standard 533mm (21") submarine torpedo tubes, it collapses in on itself for storage. This reduces the length and diameter and allows two to be stored in a single torpedo tube.

The body is almost entirely diver accomodation so although it is torpedo shaped, it is quite slow and performance is generally similar to top-end DPVs.
