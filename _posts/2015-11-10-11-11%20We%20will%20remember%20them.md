 *In Flanders fields the poppies blow*

Between the crosses, row on row,  

That mark our place; and in the sky   

The larks, still bravely singing, fly   

Scarce heard amid the guns below.   
   

We are the Dead. Short days ago   

We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,   

Loved and were loved, and now we lie,   

In Flanders fields.   
   

Take up our quarrel with the foe:   

To you from failing hands we throw   

The torch; be yours to hold it high.   

If ye break faith with us who die   

We shall not sleep, though poppies grow   

In Flanders fields. 

**In Flanders Fields**

*John McCrea, 1917*
