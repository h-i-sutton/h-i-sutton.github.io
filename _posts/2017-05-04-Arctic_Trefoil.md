**Photos of construction of Russian Artic Trefoil Base**   
![Flag](/images/flag_russia.jpg) Russia recently showcased its ‘new’ Arctic Trefoil military base on Alexandra Land in the Franz Josef Land archipelago in the Arctic. Infrastructure includes accommodation for 150 personnel with up to 18 months supplies. It has a ‘self-powered energy unit’ (e.g. nuclear?) and is independent from the outside world.  

As it was shown to the media:
