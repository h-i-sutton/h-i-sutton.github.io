#Guide To Iran's Navy & IRGC's Drone Carriers, Forward Base Ships, and Covert Intelligence Ships![Flag Iran](/images/flag_iran.jpg) The Iranian Navy and IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps) both employ a growing number of large ships as drone carriers, forward operating bases and covert intelligence platforms. These vessels use merchant ship hulls but with new decks and an array of armaments. Some qualify as auxiliaries under international law. However most are armed with offensive armament of missiles and thus qualify as warships (auxiliaries may not lawfully commit belligerent acts in an international armed conflict). Thus these vessels stress the boundaries of international law.  

The vessels are converted from large merchant ships, either bought or seized by the Iranian government. As such they are much larger, and more robustly built, than Iran's naval traditional naval vessels. These conversions have been carried out at the ISOICO shipyard about 25km (15 miles) west of the main naval base of Bandar Abbas at the entrance to the Persian Gulf.   

There is no serious suggestion that these ships are directly involved in any [drone incidents along the U.S. coast](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cq8q5q53ypjt). The ships are however very interesting and illustrate the dramatic transformation of the Iranian Navy, and IRGC Navy, in recent years.

##I.R.I.S. Shahid Bagheri (C-110-4), Drone CarrierThe Iranian IRGC's (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps) most ambitious naval project, a merchant ship has been converted to a unique flat-top drone carrier. The ship is currently [undergoing sea trials](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2024-11-29-Iran-Shahid-Bagheri-Sea-Trials %}).  

The Shahid Bagheri (C-110-4), previously the container ship Perarin (IMO: 9209350), has a distinctive reverse angled deck. The aircraft land heading towards the starboard (right) side, instead of the usual port (left) direction. This allows the flight deck to pass the full-beam containership superstructure which is largely unchanged.   
![Iran Shahid Bagheri](/images/Iran-Shahid-Bagheri-deck.jpg)  
The ship is 240 meter long ship has a maximum take-off run of just under 175 meters. The landing run is around 65 meters and appears to have arrester gear. The ship is likely to be seen with relatively large fixed-wing UAVs (uncrewed air vehicles). These might include folding wing types generally similar to the Shahed-129, Gaza or newer Kaman-22, all of which are somewhat influenced by the American Predator/Reaper family.  

The large flight deck would not be required for vertical take-off drones, or one-way-attack drones (OWA-UAVs). And the ski jump bow suggest relatively heavy types. The IRGC has a number of fixed-wing drones which might operate from the ship. These may include the 'Gaza' or similar Reaper-like types. The main limitation will be wingspans.

##I.R.I.S. Shahid Mahdavi (110-3), Forward Base ShipThe I.R.I.S. Shahid Mahdavi (110-3) started life the same way as the I.R.I.S. Shahid Bagheri did, as a container ship. The Savin (IMO 9209348) was converted in 2022 and is now in service.

![Iran Shahid Mahdavi](/images/Iran-Shahid-Mahdavi-IRGC.jpg)  
The deck has been plated over and two generous helicopter landing pads marked. Anti-ship missiles are located behind the superstructure. On February 13 2024 'Dezful' medium range ballistic missiles were launched from shipping containers on the forward deck.

##I.R.I.N.S. Makran (441), The Largest Forward Base ShipIn 2020 the Iranian Navy is joining the IRGC in converting large merchant ships to function as Forward Base Ships. The Iranian Navy's version, the I.R.I.N.S. Makran (441), is by far the largest. This is similar in concept to the expeditionary mobile base (EMB). In terms of overall dimensions it is approximately the same size as the U.S> Navy's USS Lewis B. Puller (ESB-3).  
![Iran Shahid Mahdavi](/images/Iran-Makran-Port.jpg)  
![Iran Shahid Mahdavi](/images/Iranian-Navy-IRINS-Makran.jpg)  
The I.R.I.N.S. Makran, previously called Persian Gulf, is a tanker conversion. In 2021 the ship was used to transport a delivery of fast attack craft to Venezuela. The mission was aborted, possibly due to world attention, but the FACs were later delivered.  

**Specifications**  
Displacement: 121,000 t   
Length: 230.13 m (755 ft 0 in)  
Beam: 42.03 m (137 ft 11 in)  
Height: 21.5 m (70 ft 6 in)  
Endurance: 1,000 days reported  
Aircraft carried: 6-7 helicopters

##Unnamed Ship, The Next One Being ConvertedAnother merchant ship is under conversion at the ISOICO shipyard west of Bandar Abbas. Its name when it enters Iranian Navy (or possibly IRGC) service has not been reported. The conversion is similar to Makran although the ship is smaller, around 150 meters long and 25 meters across.  
![Iran ABTIN-1](/images/Iran-ABTIN-1.jpg)  
Work on the conversion began in 2023 and appears much slower than the other conversions. She is currently still in dry dock at ISOICO.

##Saviz, The First IRGC Covert Forward Base Ship In Red SeaThis ship is a covert naval vessel, operating under the cover of being an innocent merchant ship. Saviz is an Iranian flagged general cargo vessel which was used as an offshore surveillance, command & liaison base by the IRGC operating in the [Red Sea from 2017 until 2019](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2021-04-06-IRGC-Saviz-Update %}). It was also likely used as a base for Iranian shipboard guards joining ships sailing to and from Syria. In April 2021 it was attacked with limpet mines in the Red Sea. The ship was subsequently withdrawn and replaced by the similar *Behshad*. After repair Saviz returned to service and appears to now be operating as an intelligence ship (AGI) in the Indian Ocean.

##Behshad, Infamous Covert Forward Base Ship In Red SeaBehshad was a straightforward replacement for the Saviz in the Red Sea after the latter was limpet mined in 2019. Like Saviz she is a covert naval vessel, operating under the cover of being an innocent merchant ship.   

Behshad is a sistership of Saviz and with the same general arrangement and specifications. She operated in the position that Saviz had vacated until 2023 Red Sea crisis. During this she is widely suspected of having provided intelligence and targeting assistance to the Yemeni Houthis as they attacked merchant ships. In early 2024, under mounting international pressure the ship withdrew from the Red Sea, ultimately retreating back to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas.

##I.R.I.S. Shahid Roudaki (L-110-1)The IRGC's first overt forward base ship, the Shahid Roudaki was converted in 2021. The ship was originally the Ro-Ro/container ship GALAXY F (IMO: 9048471). It is relatively small, 150 meters long and 21.6 meters wide. The forward deck is used for landing helicopters and carrying vehicles. 8 x Qader anti-ship missiles are carried on the forward deck.

##Other Drone Launching ShipsThe Iranian Navy has previously demonstrated launching waves of one-way-attack drones (OWA-UAVs) from the Hengam class landing ship (LST) I.R.I.N.S. Lavan, and the Delvar class auxiliary I.R.I.N.S. Delvar.
