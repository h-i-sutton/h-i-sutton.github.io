 **COVERT SHORES**  tells the story of Naval Special Forces, their underwater missions, tactics and in particular their underwater vehicles. Units covered include the US Navy’s SEALs, Britain’s Special Boat Service (SBS) and many more. Just doing some proofing, nearly there. Thanks to everyone who has helped, I would be nowhere without your continued support.![taster](\images/preview3.jpg)
