# New Iranian Warship Design With VLS

![Flag Iran](/images/flag_iran.jpg) Images shared on social media reveal a new Iranian warship design. The type appears to be connected the regular Navy rather than the less conventional IRGC. While Iran displays a regular stream of these ship models, many of which never make it into the water, this one seems more credible. It is modest in overall terms but also represents a major modernization to Iranian Naval capabilities.

The small corvette is approximately 80 meters long and features a helipad at the stern. Overall armament is more extensive than existing Iranian warships. Crucially there appears to be a VLS (Vertical Launch System) amidships. This appears to have 8 cells, which is a more sensible amount than seen on some previous designs.   

What will be carried in the VLS is not reported. However the fact that it has C-802 type missiles in typical box launchers suggest that this will not be an anti-ship missile. The most likely explanation seems some form of air defense missile. This has been substantially lacking in Iranian warships until now.   

The design also features a 76mm 'Fajr-27' dual-purpose autocannon. This is an unlicensed copy of the classic Italian OTO Melara 76mm compact mount. It now features a more stealthy angled casing almost identical to those found on newer Italian made examples.   

Close-in weaponry consists of two Kamand 30mm anti-aircraft mounts. These are copies of the Soviet / Russian AK630 weapon. These also feature a more modern looking angled casing. Two smaller cannons or machine guns, possibly remote weapons stations, are on extended sponsons.

As always we should use caution in translating a model into an actual boat. And moreso for Iranian types. But overall this type seems much more plausible than many other designs,
