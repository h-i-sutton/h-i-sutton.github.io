![](/images/flag_germany.jpg) Ulrich Gabler (1 October 1913 – 24 February 1994) was a German naval architect best known for founding the company which designed the Cold War Type-201, Type-202 and Type-209 submarines. Less well known but equally respected are his company’s swimmer delivery vehicles.   

During World War Two Gabler served as chief engineer aboard several U-Boats including U-121 and U-564. He received the German Cross in Gold on 15 October 1942. He was involved in the design and development of the Type-XXII, Type-XVII A and Type-XXVI uboat designs. After the war he founded the Ingenieurkontor Lübeck (IKL). His name lives on [Gabler Maschinenbau](https://www.gabler-maschinenbau.de/unternehmen/)

**Sea Devil 2-person human torpedo**  
Dubbed the **Sea Devil** and 'Unterwasserschwimmhilfe' (underwater swimmers' float), Gabler's two-man SDV (Swimmer Delivery Vehicle) is a unique reintrepration of the Human Torpedo concept. It is closest to the Russian *Sirena* series of SDVs, although a closer comparison might be the Swedish (/British) *Torpedo-SEAL* DPV. Designed to fit within standard 533mm (21") submarine torpedo tubes, it collapses in on itself for storage. This reduces the length and diameter and allows two to be stored in a single torpedo tube.   

#### 

The body is almost entirely diver accomodation so although it is torpedo shaped, it is quite slow and performance is generally similar to top-end DPVs.
