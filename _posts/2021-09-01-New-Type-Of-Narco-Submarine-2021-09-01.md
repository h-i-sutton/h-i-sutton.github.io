# Colombian Navy Interdicts Super Low-Profile Narco Submarine

The Colombian Navy has interdicted an unusual narco-submarine in the Pacific. The four-motor craft, a type of low-profile vessel (LPV), has an extremely low cabin. From some angles it almost appears to not have a cabin at all.

The LPV was carrying 1.872 tons of cocaine carried in 90 bales. The drugs were marked with a 'Royalion Tagline' logo. These marks are for tracking only and it is common for the markings to have no connection to the cartel. The operation was reportedly associated with the “Western Bloque Alfonso Cano” residual FARC organization.

The intelligence-led operation was spearheaded by Units of the Marine Infantry Brigade No. 4, They were supported by vessels of the navy's Pacific Surface Flotilla, and troops from the *National Army Command Against Drug Trafficking and Transnational Threats*.   

The LPV was interdicted as its tried to leave an estuary in the north of Nariño. The crew jumped overboard when they realized that they were about to be boarded. They were able to escape into the mangroves and left on a speed boat which appears to have been escorting them.   

The vessel was 17 meters (55 feet) long, and has a generally triangular plan form. The layout is generally typical but the cockpit is unusually low profile.
