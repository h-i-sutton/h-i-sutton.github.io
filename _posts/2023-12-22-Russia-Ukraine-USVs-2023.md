#Maritime Drones (USVs) Of The Russo-Ukrainian War, 2022-23![Flag Russia](/images/flag_russia.jpg) ![Flag Ukraine](/images/flag_ukraine.jpg) Although USVs (uncrewed surface vessels) have been under development for navies for some years, the war in the Black Sea has redefined them. Ukraine in particular has exploited emerging communications technologies to create effective USVs. This has allowed them to achieve a level of sea denial despite not having a significant conventional navy. Russia too have experimented with these concepts and is now, a year on, looking to deploy similar systems.   

We have also seen some development of semi-submerged or fully submerged versions. These fall under the UUV (uncrewed underwater vehicle) category.  

All current designs are characterized as being relatively small, much smaller than if humans had to be carried. This has many advantages.   

There are, for sure, more types under development. This visualization only includes publicly revealed types.
