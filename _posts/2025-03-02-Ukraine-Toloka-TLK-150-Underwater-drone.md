#Ukraine's Toloka TLK-150 Underwater Drone![Flag Ukraine](/images/flag_ukraine.jpg) The Russian Navy is doing badly in the Russo-Ukraine War, losing control of the Black Sea. Ukraine's maritime surface drones (USVs - uncrewed surface vessels) have denied them sea control, and pushed them back to the eastern coast of the Black Sea. However, it is a constantly evolving battlefield and Russia has been improving its defenses against USVs. Among the development Ukrainian engineers have up their sleeves, are underwater versions of drones. The **Toloka TLK-150** is a publicly displayed version.

The Toloka TLK-150 has a conventional tubular fuselage with two main segments joined end to end. Cruciform control surfaces are mounted near the stern. Unusually, but pragmatically, it has two small thrusters mounted one either side of the stern, instead of a single larger thruster. It is around length is 2.5 meters long, has a reported range of 100km (54 nautical miles), and has a reported payload of 20 - 50 kg of explosives. A mast can be used for above-surface sensors and communication.

The Toloka TLK-150 was [displayed to visiting dignitaries](https://mil.in.ua/en/news/ukrainian-underwater-drone-toloka-is-being-updated-what-s-new-in-the-tlk-150-model/)in February 2025 as one of the achievements of the Ukrainian defense industry.

The design was first revealed in an exhibition by Ukrainian defence fund [Brave-1 in April 2023](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2023-04-26-New-Ukraine-Underwater-Maritime-Drone %}). A mock-up, or possibly a prototype, was shown. That vehicle was distinctly different from the one now shown, appearing cruder and with some unusual lines for an underwater drone. It had a keel, widely spaced thrusters on 'wings' and a very small rudder. The newer version appears more conventional, and thus mature.
