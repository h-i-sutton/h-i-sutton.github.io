#Notes On Emerging Iranian / Houthi Uncrewed Underwater Vehicle (UUV) Threat![Flag Iran](/images/flag_iran.jpg)![Flag Houthi](/images/flag_Houthi.jpg) Today (Feb 18) CENTCOM announced that it has "successfully conducted five self-defense strikes against three mobile anti-ship cruise missiles, one unmanned underwater vessel (UUV), and one unmanned surface vessel (USV) in Iranian-backed Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen." It went on to note that "This is the first observed Houthi employment of a UUV since attacks began in Oct. 23.". This is confirmation that Iranian type AUVs / UUVs (autonomus underwater vehicle / uncrewed underwater vehicle) are being used in Yemen.

This builds on an earlier report revealing that UUVs of some kind are being supplied. On February 15 [CENTCOM announced](https://twitter.com/CENTCOM/status/1758084937331454351) that an Iranian dhow had been stopped transporting weapons to the Houthis in Yemen. The shipment included elements of UUV and USV technology. Limited photos were made available:

*US Coast Guard / CENTCOM released photo of weapons seized aboard an Iranian dhow on February 15 2024. The seizure included UUV and USV components. The annotations, highlighting possible UUV parts, have been added.*  

Iran has several designs for AUVs including ones which are only partially revealed. The most likely candidate for the Houthi supply at this point is a torpedo-like drone which has featured in [several propaganda videos](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2022-03-16-Iran-IRGC-Weaponized-UUV %}). This one-way attack underwater drone (OWA-AUV) is relatively small but can likely inflict significant damage on ships.

Primarily it can be thought of as a weapon for use against static targets such as harbours and ships at anchor. But it could conceivably be launched against moving ships as a form of torpedo. Its ability to home in on a target is unclear, but it can raise a short mast. This may be for Electro-optical or infrared observation of the target. The device is possibly wire guided, in which case the range might be more constrained.

##Unidentified Iranian UUVThere is at least one other similar design. This appears to be slightly larger and have a sail and larger upper rudder.
