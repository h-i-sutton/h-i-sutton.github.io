**Swimmer Delivery Vehicle (SDV) news roundup**  

**JFD acquire Ortega Submersibles**  
![](/images/flag_netherlands.jpg) ![](/images/flag_UK.jpg) British-based marine services and diving & underwater systems provider [James Fisher Defence (JFD)](https://www.jfdglobal.com/markets/defence/) has acquired Dutch SDV start-up [Ortega Submersibles](https://www.ortega-submersibles.com/) who are known for their highly-sophisticated submersible canoe designs. Their main military product is the [Mk.1D 4-person SDV](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2017-06-09-Ortega_SDV %}).   
![SDV_News_2019-08 - Covert Shores](/images/UK-NL_Ortega_JFD.jpg)  
The deal covers all the assets, IP and designs rights of Ortega Submersibles, and the Dutch team at Enschede will continue operating as a new subsidiary JFD Ortega BV.

Ortega’s publicly revealed products are all smaller than JFD’s existing SEAL Carrier submersible boats (see below), but larger than the [Torpedo SEAL](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2016-03-13-Torpedo%20SEAL%20diver%20propulsion%20device %}) two-person diver propulsion device (DPD).   

**Subsea Craft reveal VICTA-02**  
![SDV_News_2019-08 - Covert Shores](/images/UK_Subseacraft_VICTA-02.jpg)  
![](/images/flag_UK.jpg) British based submersible boat builder [SubSeaCraft](https://www.subseacraft.com/) has released the first images of its next generation SDV, the VICTA-02. Unlike its distinctive catamaran [Diver Delivery Unit (DDU)](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2017-10-17-SubSeaCraft_DDU %}) design the new craft has a more typical monohull form. It differs from most other western submersible boat designs by not being a RHIB (rigid hulled inflatable boat) design. Although a high-speed semi-planing hull, the bow and upper surfaces are distinctly rounded to reduce underwater resistance. The crew/passengers, and this appears to be an 8-person wet-sub like the previous design, are accommodated in an enclosed compartment with windows and top hatches.   
![SDV_News_2019-08 - Covert Shores](/images/UK_Subseacraft_VICTA-02_Top.jpg)  
The more conventional hull form may have different underwater performance and handling characteristics to the catamaran design. The new vehicle will be unveiled at [DSEI 2019](http://dsei2019.org/) in London on 10-13th September (Stand S10-150).

Norwegian firm [Henriksen](https://www.hhenriksen.com/rebs) make a range of **Rebs** ladders for Special Forces and law enforcement applications. The system shown here is suitible to maritime counter-terrorism Special Forces and commandos, and is more commonly associated with fast boats, typically RHIBS, and divers.
