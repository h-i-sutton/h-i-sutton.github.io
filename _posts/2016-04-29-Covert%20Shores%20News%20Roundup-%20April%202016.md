French shipbuilding giant DCNS Group has won the $50bn AUS deal to supply the Royal Australian Navy’s next generation of attack submarines. The 12 boat deal involves local construction of the Shortfin Barracuda design.   
  

The Shortfin Barracuda is a diesel-electric derivative of the French Navy’s own next generation nuclear powered boat, the Baracuda SSN.

It is unclear whether Australia’s boats will have Air Independent Power (AIP) installed, and if so whether it will be the French MESMA type or the increasingly popular Fuel Cell type. In order to generate power while the submarine is submerged, MESMA runs a steam turbine off the chemical reaction between ethanol and oxygen. In many respects it is based on nuclear propulsion but with an alternative heat source. Currently it is only in service with the Pakistani Navy. France is reported to be developing a fuel cell alternative, and US supplied fuel cells were used on the Franco-Spanish S-80 Class.

The above photograph, found on the internet when researching the WP-18 boat (possibly from http://www.exxafrica.com/ematum-anti-piracy-interceptors-set-sail-for-pemba/), has been identified as having been taken in Mozambique. I had wrongly thought that it was taken in UAE. This is embarrassing as the supply to Mozambique, where they are intended for anti-piracy, was reported on the internet. Two people separately alerted me to my mistake this week – many thanks!

23rd April 2016 0630hrs (Local): North Korea test fired an NK-11 “북극성-1” (Pukgeukseong-1’) Submarine launched Ballistic Missile (SLBM) off its East coast, near the submarine’s current home port of Sinpo. This is the second reported test of the missile, and the first from the Sinpo Class submarine. Although the North claimed success, the missile only travelled 19 miles suggesting a failure soon after launch. SLBM development is full of failed launches so this should not be taken as failure of the program. Instead it is another step towards a limited operational capability. More on the sinpo soon.

 **Another Narco-Sub intercept in Pacific**   
  

![Narco submarine](/images/Narco_Apr2016.jpg)  

13th April 2016. A narco-sub was intercepted by Colombian forces 250 nautical miles offshore in the Pacific near the Ecuadorian border. It was a very typical Low Profile Vessel (LPV) with 5.8 tons of cocaine aboard. Four crewmen were arrested. This is at least the forth narco-sub incident this year.
