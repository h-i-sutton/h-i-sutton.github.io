![Flag Russia](/images/flag_russia.jpg)  Although Moscow remains in the top tier of modern submarine technology, they have fallen some way behind other countries autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Russian design bureaus, notably Rubin and Lazurit, and maintain a steady stream of proposals which offer a path to catch up, at least with the pack. Argus-D is a new AUV designed by Russia’s Rubin Design Bureau as part of a family. It is optimised for deploying objects to the sea floor. Official materials suggest that this is for civilian or scientific purposes, such as beacons, but the offensive military potential is clear.
