# New Imagery Shows Ginormous Warship Construction, China

![Flag](/images/flag_China.jpg) Google Earth has updated its imagery of Shanghai, providing clear images of Jiangnan shipyard. This is where the Type-003 aircraft carrier is being built. But it is also where the enigmatic sailless submarine is. The submarine remains at the shipyard, where it has been since its launch in October 2018.

The submarine is likely still under trials. Details of its designation , customer (PLAN?) and role remain elusive.
