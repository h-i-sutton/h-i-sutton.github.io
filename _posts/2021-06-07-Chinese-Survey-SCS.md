# Survey Warfare: 3 Chinese Ships Of Interest In The South China Sea

![Flag China](/images/flag_China.jpg) Chinese ships, of various types and capabilities, have been surveying the South China Sea. Regardless of the individual ship or organization, these activities may have either military and civilian motives. And either way the data gathered is of interest to military planners. The surveys are anyway controversial because of the contested territorial and economic claims.   

During the last couple of years three vessels have performed particularly interesting surveys.   
  

## White Hull: DONG FANG HONG 3

![Chinese Survey Activities In South China Sea](/images/China-Survey-DONG-FANG-HONG-3-pic.jpg)  

The 5,000 ton survey ship DONG FANG HONG 3 (IMO: 9801110, MMSI: 413332930) is a relatively new design, built in 2019 for the China Ocean University. She is described as a deep-water general survey vessel. The design emphasizes noise-reduction to improve sensor performance, and minimize disruption to wildlife.   

During her sea trials she surveyed parts of the Mariana Trench. This included lowering her sonar to at least 10,884 meters in Challenger Deep. This main acoustic system is dropped over the stern on a large derrick. She can also carry ROVs and other survey equipment.   

In 2020 she deployed to the South China Sea and carried out survey activities in an area known as the South China Basin (vicinity 15.2383, 114.673). This included multiple extremely slow speed sections and long stops, suggesting the lowering of the main sonar system.

## Red Hull: HAI YANG DI ZHI BA HAO

![Chinese Survey Activities In South China Sea](/images/China-Survey-Hai-Yang-Di-Zhi-Ba-Hao.jpg)  

Owned by the Chinese Government, the red painted Hai Yang Di Zhi Ba Hao (IMO: 9780756, MMSI: 413491890) is associated with oil exploration. The ship appears to be equipped with a towed [seismic survey array]({% post_url 2020-02-04-Seismic_Survey_Sub %}). This uses active sonar to see below the sea floor. The receivers for the array are towed behind the ship on wide swing arms. The starboard swing arm is visible stowed in the above photograph.   

This boat's activities have been particularly controversial. In 2019 is conducted a very extensive survey in Vietnam's EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zone). Vietnam protracted by the survey continued.

During its survey it was escorted by 14 vessels, believed to be from China's **Maritime Militia**. Having a handful of guard boats (aka chase boats) is not unusual for this type of survey because the towed arrays are vulnerable. Chase boats ahead on either side of the vessel to spot fishing gear, other vessels, or unexpected obstacles. And they often have one astern if the activity in the area warrants. The chase boats may have a wi-lan connection to the navigation system so they are all aware of each others position as well as the survey vessel.

In a sense it is like a virtual survey where features, incidents and obstacles are plotted. This helps the survey vessel and chase boats to guide other vessels safely around the towed arrays.   

In the context of the South China Sea the guard boats have the added role of deterring interference by other countries.

The 2019 survey covered most of the western side of the South China Sea and took several months. The ship stopped periodically at Fiery Cross Reef, a Chinese controlled island.   

A year later the ship was again conducting seismic surveys in the South China Sea. This time she concentrated on a smaller area nearer to Hainan. The survey is unusual for being so neat and orderly, possibly beyond the point where it becomes inefficient. Again the ship had guard boats, but many fewer.

## Green Hull: SHI YAN 1

The Shi Yan-1, (IMO: 9405758, MMSI: 413542000) meaning *Experiment 1*, is part of the fleet supporting the Chinese Academy of Sciences. A SWATH (Small Waterplane Area Twin Hull) design, it has two very narrow catamaran hulls beneath a voluminous boxy superstructure. The basic layout has since been adopted by Chinese Navy anti-submarine surveillance ships, some of which share the same home port.

In 2019 it is was detected operating off Port Blair in India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands.   

In May 2020 she performed a survey in the mid-SCS. This involved cruising in an unusual circular path, about 60 nautical miles in diameter. In the center she performed multiple smaller searches, both before and after running the circular path:
