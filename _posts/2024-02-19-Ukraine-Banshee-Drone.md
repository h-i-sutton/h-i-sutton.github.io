#First Sighting Of British Banshee Jet-Powered Drone In Ukraine![Flag Ukraine](/images/flag_ukraine.jpg) ![Flag UK](/images/flag_UK.jpg) At least one British-made Banshee target drone has been reported crashed behind Russian lines. The Banshee Jet 80 is a high-performance twin jet drone used by the Royal Navy and others. In Ukrainian service it is likely being used as a one-way attack drone (OWA-UAV) to strike high value targets deep behind the front line.

*The crashed example reportedly at Novoazovs'k, Donetsk, around 100km behind the front line.*  

The crashed example has minor differences to observed target drones, most notably some type of rail under the belly. This is likely part of the launch system and not part of the drone. Further details of weaponization unclear.  

The Meggitt Banshee is a long-serving target drone used to test missiles since the 1980s. It comes in both piston and jet powered variants. New versions are marketed by Qinetiq.   

The Jet 80 model, which appears to be the type observed in Ukraine, is fitted with twin 40 kg thrust gas turbine engines. This gives it 80 kg static thrust, allowing an impressive speed of 720 km/h (Mach 0.6). Range is not public but endurance is over 45 minutes. The design can carry a payload.
