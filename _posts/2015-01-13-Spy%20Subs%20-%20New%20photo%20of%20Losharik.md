There are few active submarines as elusive as the Russian 'Special Projects' boat 'Losharik' so this new photo is something of a find! It seems that a Russian version of the Top Gear car program inadvertently photographed it during a test drive and posted it on the internet not realizing how secretive it is! The Project 10830 / 10831 / 210 LOSHARIK submarine is small 70m submarine used for very deep diving 'underwater engineering' (read spying) by the Russians and can be viewed as the follow-on to the Cold War Project 1910 UNIFORM boat.

I am working on illustrations and analysis which may help further demystify this boat but that is taking some time.
