#New Ukrainian Weaponized Jet Ski Used In Crimea Raid![Flag Ukraine](/images/flag_ukraine.jpg) Ukraine continues to surprise observers, with yet another variation of uncrewed surface vessel (USV) revealed by the latest round of raids on Russian-occupied Crimea. The USV is evidently a modified yet ski. Last month, a [weaponized Yamaha Waverunner FX jet ski was found]({% post_url 2024-07-27-Ukraine-USV-Jetski %}) on Turkish beach near Istanbul. That craft was less extensively modified, suggesting that this is the second-generation iteration.

The personal watercraft has been modified as an uncrewed vessel (USV). It has an electro-optical / infrared camera ball forward, approximately where the handlebars ought to be. A radar antenna is mounted further aft on an angled mast. It is unclear whether this mast can be retracted or folded to reduce the vessel's profile. Unlike the earlier observed modified jet ski, this example has a new superstructure. Possibly this also contains a Starlink antenna.

*Still from a video of Russian forces destroying it by small arms fire at point blank range following the overnight raid on August 16-17 2024.*  

The role of the craft is unconfirmed, but may be intelligence gathering. A spike-like protrusion is visible at the bow, suggesting an impact detonation fuse for a warhead.   

#American Link?The design is reminiscent of the **Mako** from [Aevex Aerospace](https://aevex.com/unmanned-surface-vehicles/), suggesting a possible connection to the American company.
