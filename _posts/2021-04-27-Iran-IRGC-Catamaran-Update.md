#New Photo Of Shahid Soleimani Class Catamaran![Flag Iran](/images/flag_iran.jpg) Imagery is slowly emerging confirming the construction of new missile corvettes for Iran's IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps). A candid photograph has been shared on Telegram of one being fitted out at Qeshm Island. It is the same one observed at the [Madkandaloo Shipbuilding](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2021-04-13-Iran-IRGC-Navy-Yard-On-Qeshm-Island %}) Cooperative Co yard. The site is one of three where the new craft are being built.   

The image confirms that the main armament will consist of four C-802 Noor family anti-ship missiles. These are housed in regular box launchers which are now visible just behind the bridge, firing forwards and outwards.
