# 4 New T-Shirts In The Store

I don't plug the Covert Shores store very often, it is not what this site is about. The T-shirts, mugs and posters are there for the serious submarine interest group, people who know. And popular demand.  
  
But as the holiday season rapidly approaches, I thought that I should add some new options. Hopefully, if you are looking for submarine themed clothing tis may help. Thank you.
