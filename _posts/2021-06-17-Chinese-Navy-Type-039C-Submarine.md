#New Images Of Chinese Navy's Latest Type-039C Yuan Class Submarine![Flag China](/images/flag_China.jpg) A clearer video has emerged of the new model of Type-039A 'Yuan' family submarines. I first reported the new sub-class [in Naval News](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2021/05/image-may-reveal-a-new-type-of-submarine-for-the-chinese-navy/) on May 12. Provisionally known as the Type-039**C**, the new design is likely to be significant, a major upgrade to an already competitive design.

The new video shows the submarine being moved along a river. This is most likely the Yangtze, which the submarine was launched into in Wuhan. Presumably it is being moved downstream for further work and tests. There is a related shipyard on the outskirts of Wuhan [where Yuan submarines are also built]({% post_url 2021-03-13-Chinese-Submarines-Seen-At-Wuchang %}), so it may have been moved there for fitting out.   

My current thinking is that the new sail design most likely relates to a sonar or communications system. Less obvious than the new sail, there also appears to be a thin wire towed array sonar (TAS) in the upper rudder, a major upgrade.

*CLICK to enlarge. The first image was taken from a moving vehicle. The new submarine can be seen through the railings. The design appears to have a new sail (A), possibly a redesigned upper rudder (B) and generally cleaner outer hull (C).*
