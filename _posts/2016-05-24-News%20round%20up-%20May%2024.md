![Covert Shores News round up- May 24](/images/NewsMay24.jpg)   
A collection of recent events and fresh info relating to Special Forces and/or submarines. Thank you to everyone who feeds me interesting news and articles. This isn’t all of them, but keep them coming!   

 **Proteus SDV shows 'new' tail configuration**   
![Flag](/images/flag_USA.jpg) Several Twitter users ([StuSladeFI](https://twitter.com/StuSladeFI), [Richard Thomas](https://twitter.com/RT_Shephard)) posted pictures of Huntington Ingalls' Proteus SDV at SeaAirSpace defense expo at the GAYLORD NATIONAL CONVENTION CENTER, Fort Washington, MD, USA. The images show a new tail configuration with additional horizontal control surfaces (actually the tail was modified over a year ago, but these are the first images I've seen of it).

 **US DoD tests MANTAS armed unmanned underwater vehicles**   
![Flag](/images/flag_USA.jpg) Twitter account [twitter.com/DoD_HDIAC](https://twitter.com/DoD_HDIAC) posts some great images. This set is particularly interesting and shows the future trend in underwater warfare. The images show a demonstration of the **MANTAS** armed unmanned underwater vehicles at SOFIC 2016 (Special Operations Forces Industry Conference) being held (May 23–26) at the Tampa Convention Center, Tampa, FL. MARTAC Maritime Tactical Systems' *man-portable tactical autonomous System* (MANTAS) is primarily intended for ISR missions.

 **ALUSAFE 1100 Fast Interceptor demonstrated at SOFIC 2016**   
![Flag](/images/flag_USA.jpg) An interesting fast boat with SF applications. Possibly more info to follow.

[defence-blog] **Russian Navy will receive more Raptors**   
![Flag](/images/flag_russia.jpg) [defense-blog.com](http://defence-blog.com/news/russian-navy-will-receive-more-raptor-high-speed-patrol-boats.html) reports that the Russian Navy will receive 10 more Raptor assault boats. Thee are similar to the Swedish CB90 design.

 **Mystery solved: Russian Navy patrol boats deploy to Syria**   
![Flag](/images/flag_russia.jpg) Following on from the heavily camouflaged Russian boats seen transiting the Bosporus en-route to Syria, (see previous post [here]({% post_url 2016-05-08-Russian%20Assault%20Boats%20head%20to%20Syria %})), two patrol boats have turned up in Syrian waters. These are not as formidable as the Raptor assault boats originally suggested. No doubt NATO, with its better camera technology, would have correctly identified these under the camouflage netting but I am not beating us amateur observers up about it.

[JANES'] **China proposes 'Underwater Great Wall' that could erode US, Russian submarine advantages**   
![Flag](/images/flag_china.jpg) Janes' reports that China is building an underwater 'great wall' in the China Sea using technologies similar to SOSUS.   
> "*The China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) has proposed the construction of a network of ship and subsurface sensors that could significantly erode the undersea warfare advantage held by US and Russian submarines and contribute greatly to future Chinese ability to control the South China Sea (SCS).*
