**'Diver Delivery Craft' Special Forces underwater vehicle revealed**[![](/images/Icon_Bluesky.jpg)](https://bsky.app/profile/covertshores.bsky.social)  

The DSI **Diver Delivery Craft** was showcased at [UDT-2018](https://www.udt-global.com/) in Glasgow, Scotland. Previously the vehicle has not been revealed to the public.

The design appears to be three-person, sitting in-line with open cockpits. Large wing-like hydroplanes are positioned fore and aft, with an almost bat-like shape. There are vertical thrusters mounted in the forward hydroplane fairing, and electric thrusters and vertical rudders below the aft set. The design is propelled on the surface via a single waterjet with thrust reverser. This arrangement suggests a diesel engine for surface mode. No snorkel is visible however.
