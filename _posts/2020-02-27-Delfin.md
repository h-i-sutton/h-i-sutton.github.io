Cuba maintains a shroud of secrecy around its sole active submarine, the 21m (70ft) **Delfin**. Recent satellite imagery shows that she is still active and operates from both her home base at Cabanas and occasionally from the capitol Havana.

Very little is known about the boat but we can deduce some basic facts. She is a ~20m (65ft) dry sub with a crew of at least five men. She has a single diesel engine which does not appear to have a snort mast, instead a crude inverted u-bend type exhaust is visible at the back of the sail. We do not know if she is armed but she is large enough to assume twin 533mm torpedoes could be carried externally.

Rumors that she is of North Korean design appear in error although there is evidence from North Korean defectors that Cuban officials inspected North Korean submarines in 1990s. So it is possible that the Cuban program was influenced by North Korean designs such as the Yugo Class. A stronger influence appears be the Russian SPLC X-Craft.
