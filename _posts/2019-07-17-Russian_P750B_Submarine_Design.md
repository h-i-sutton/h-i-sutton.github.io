[![](/images/Icon_Bluesky.jpg)](https://bsky.app/profile/covertshores.bsky.social)**New Russian Submarine design: P-750B**  
   

The design adds to Malachite’s extensive range of relatively small designs offered for export. To date they have not achieved export success.

These compact designs are intended for inshore ship attack and anti-submarine warfare, as well as landing a large force of Naval Special Forces (Spetsnaz) to attack land targets. There is also the inference that they could carry cruise missiles to attack targets inland, although the number of rounds which could be carried hasn’t been confirmed.   

The most interesting design feature is that the 12 torpedo tubes are carried in a frame which is lowered in to the outer hull from above. Malachite’s rival submarine design bureau Rubin patented a similar arrangement.

*Although the propulsion looks like a pumpjet at first glance, it is actually a more basic six-blade shrouded screw (‘Kort nozzle’) similar to other Malachite designs including the [Losharik spy submarine]({% post_url 2021-07-18-Spy%20Sub%20-%20Project%2010831%20Losharik %}). Having an even number of blades is unusual and may not reflect a production configuration.*
