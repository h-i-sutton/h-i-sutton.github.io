 **History**   
A three-man derivative of the CE2F, this type is only known to have been supplied to South Korea where it complemented earlier CE2F deliveries. It is possible that all or some of the construction took place locally. The craft is possibly also known as the **X-1** SDV. Relatively little is known about this type but it is easily recognized by the lattice cover over the perspex canopies.
