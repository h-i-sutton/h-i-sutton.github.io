![Flag](/images/flag_italy.jpg) A photo has emerged of Italian Navy U212 Class submarine *Venuti* with a Special Forces container fitted. Italy’s famous COMSUBIN Special Forces unit have a long history of maintaining extreme secrecy surrounding their extensive waterborne capabilities. Forced by modern media and the need for their suppliers to court export customers, the veil of secrecy has started to relax. But information is still very limited. This new photo was taken during Exercise Emerald 2016 off Sardinia and was posted on Twitter by a foreign participant. It shows Venuti with a container fitted on her deck. The container is supplied by mysterious Italian company CABI Cattaneo in Milan and is smaller than the Dry Deck Shelters (DDS) used by the US Navy and Royal Navy. Italy’s submarines are smaller so Italy’s SDVs (Swimmer Delivery Vehicles) are carried externally in a cradle system, likely also supplied by CABI Cattaneo.
