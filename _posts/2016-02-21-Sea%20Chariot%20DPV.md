![Flag](/images/flag_isreal.jpg) An interesting new Diver propulsion Device, this time from Israel. Technical Equipment International (TEI) Ltd ae better known for their military night vision and related underwater equipment.The Sea Chariot is a single diver device where you lay prone behind a small water shield. Unusually there is onboard air supply (a feature normally reserved for larger craft) and it uses three electric thrusters, with two in the forward hydroplanes. The configuration likely results in very high agility.

____________ **Sea Chariot Mk3**   
![Sea Chariot DPV SDV](/images/SeaChariot_Mk3.png)   
The larger three-person Sea Chariot Mk.3 design incorporates pod-style shock resistant seats for high speed surface planning using a single inboard diesel engine with a water jet. The larger size also allows for a folding mast.   

 **Specifiations:**   
Length: 7m   
Height: 1.75 meters maximum   
Beam: 2.85m with hydroplanes extended, 2m without   
Weight: 1,750kg light, 2,500kg operational   
Onboard Air supply: 42k L   
Operating depth: 30m   
Speed: 35kt surfaced, 25-30kt cruising (diesel), 3.5kt submerged (electric)   
Operational range: 150 nm (max)   
Underwater endurance: 4 hours (approx 14nm)   
Powerplant (surface): 260hp diesel engine (6-cylinder) driving a single Water jet   
Fuel: 200 L   
Power (submerged): 48v 160AmpH Lithium Ion Batteries driving 3 x 48v thrusters (two forward, one aft)

____________ **Sea Ranger**   
![Sea Chariot DPV SDV](/images/SeaRanger_2.jpg)   
Much larger again, the Sea Ranger is a Submersible Rigid Inflatable Boat (SRIB) developed along similar lines to the SubSkimmer. It is notable for its large capacity with two crew and twelve passengers. Surface propulsion is by twin outboards with waterjets, and underwater propulsion via four thrusters.   

 **Specifiations:**   
Length: 9.5m   
Beam: 2.67m   
Weight: 1,800kg light, 3,400kg fully loaded   
Operating depth: 50m   
Speed: 50kt surfaced, 25kt cruising (diesel), 5kt submerged (electric)   
Powerplant (surface): 2 x 150hp or 250hp diesel engines driving Water jets (inboard engine option)   
Fuel: 1,700 L   
Power (submerged): Lithium Ion Batteries driving 2 or 4 25hp thrusters
