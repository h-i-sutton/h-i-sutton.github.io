#New Artwork Collaboration: Walrus Class Submarine![Flag](/images/flag_netherlands.jpg) As a collaboration with **[800Tonnes Naval Art](https://800tonnes.com/en/)** (and **[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/800tonnes/)** / **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/Select1986)**), we illustrated a cutaway of the Royal Netherlands Navy Walrus Class submarine. 800Tonnes did the outer hull, and I drew in the innards. As usual I used MS Paint for the main drawing and GIMP for shading. Several people helped confirm key internal aspects.   

As always, the cutaway is intended as indicative only.
