**Yacht tracking: Russian yacht Elden**    
Super yachts usually get noticed for their bold design, impressive scale, sleek lines and massive price tag. The 29 meter long **Elden** (ЭЛДЕН) luxury motor super yacht, owned by Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, has gained notoriety for other reasons however.

*Elden with Northern Shadow moored in Molde, Norway.*  

The yacht made news due to an alleged meeting on the boat off Norway between Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Prikhodko and billionaire Oleg Deripaska.  

Super yachts are potentially interesting to defense & security observers due to their occasional relevance in international affairs. They can be tracked via a range of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) means including ship transmissions (AIS), ship spotting photos, local news media and social media.   

Elden is commonly seen in Norwegian fjords. Deripaska has vacationed in Norway on several occasions.
