Refreshingly not another populist SEAL worship book but a serious history written by a real SEAL officer. There are a lot of books about SEALs, and some cover aspects of the history behind the unit, but none like this. Officially supported by the US Navy SEAL Museum in Florida, it says that this book will be given to all SEALs graduating the famous BUD/S selection, which makes a lot of sense. The lightweight easy read format helps convey the vital facts - it's not a deep or heavy book but you will learn a lot that is not well known even among SEALs.   

Historian and former SEAL and UDT frogman Tom Hawkins is undoubtedly one of the best placed people on the planet to write such a book. I was particularly interested in the multitude of WW2 precursor units described and also in the information regarding the development of parachuting capabilities. Plus it talks about the Special Boat Units which are key but often overlooked component of Naval Special Warfare (NSW).
