![Flag](/images/flag_UEA.jpg) ![Flag](/images/flag_france.jpg) The FWS-5 Barracuda Swimmer Delivery Vehicle (SDV) is built by Emirates Marine Technology (EMT) based in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE). Benefiting from significant financial investment plus technology and expertise sourced in Europe, the FWS family of SDVs has a distinctly French influence. The FWS-5 design received some marketing in the late 2000s but the designs before it, FWS-1 > 4, are virtually unknown. Looked at together they show a clear design progressions.   

 **FWS-1 SDV**

The FWS (retrospectively FWS-1) was a relatively simple wo-man wet-sub modelled loosely on the French Navy's Vostock design ( [Cross-Ref, Vostock]({% post_url 2014-11-02-Advanced%20Swimmer%20Delivery%20Vehicle%20-%20SWUV %}) ). It had a cylindrical hull with a tandem cockpit in the forward half. Relative to the Vostock it had a less streamlined nose and forward hydroplanes mounted in front of the cockpits. The small standard propeller indicates that this was only ever an experimental type, designed to test the water. In that sense it clearly worked as the following designs will show.

 **FWS-2 SDV**

The follow-on design was significantly longer with a pointed bow and no forward watershield (which was unnecessary in military applications anyway so most SDVs don't have them). The forward hydroplanes were protected by a frame and the propeller was larger and shrouded.

 **FWS-3 & 4 SDV**

Further developments introduced advanced technology batteries carried in bullet-nosed pods recessed into the lower hull. A large storage bay was now provided behind the cockpits.

The final two-man design, the FWS-5 represents the mature produce. It is incredibly long for a two-man craft being the exact same length as the 6-man dry SDV UOES-3 Button 5.60 ( [Cross-Ref, UOES-3 Button 5.60]({% post_url 2015-06-22-SEALs%20+%20USSOCOM%20next%20generation%20sub%20UOES3 %}) ). The design incorporates a larger mission bay and a telescopic mast behind the second cockpit.
