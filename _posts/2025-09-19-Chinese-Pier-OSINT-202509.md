#OSINT: New Underwater Structures At Chinese USV/AUV Test Site![Flag China](/images/flag_China.jpg) Just south of Dalian there is a pier which has become closely associated with China's uncrewed vessel developments. The pier is associated with 702 Institute, and is likely [used for trials and development](https://news.usni.org/2021/10/11/chinese-testing-experimental-armed-drone-ships-at-secret-naval-base) of both uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Just off the pier, 600 meters (0.4 miles) out to sea, are [four marker buoys](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2022-05-27-Unidentified-Objects-Off-Chines-Naval-Base %}) which likely protect a sensitive seabed structure related to the site. This may be a docking station or beacon related to AUV navigation testing for example. Now there appears to be new seabed structures being deployed at the site.   

A special crane has been observed moored at the pier and deployed near to the four marker buoys. The crane is used for lifting and lowering structures vertically. These new objects may be seabed sensors (like 'SOSUS'), or relate directly to the testing of AUVs and USVs.

The distinctive Gantry Crane barge is normally stationed just south along the peninsular at Lushan (formerly Port Arthur). It can normally be found berthed, along with other specialist vessels, in the vicinity of 38.80524°, 121.24277°. Its name, designation and specifications are not public (?). The barge is around 50 meters (165 ft) long, 30 meters (100 ft) across, and has a crane approximately 20 meters (65 ft) tall. It has an unusual split tail design with a joined bow but large well between a catamaran-like stern. The bow is raised, suggesting that it is intended to improve seakeeping in rough weather. All indications are that this vessel was built for and operated by the Chinese Navy (PLAN).![Special crane barge China](/images/China-Crane-barge.jpg)
