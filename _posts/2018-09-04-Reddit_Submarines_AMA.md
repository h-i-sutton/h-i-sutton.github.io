**Submarines AMA (Ask Me Anything) on Reddit**  
The submarine world is one of the most unseen, unforgiving, classified, ground breaking and tight knit communities on the planet. We discover new life on almost every dedicated dive, explore the most dangerous places on Earth and even research the origin of life. Some of us live a life (akin to high security prisoners) hundreds of feet underwater, loaded with more firepower than all the WWII explosives combined, powered by a fission reactor, tasked with deterring species ending war... all while being endlessly hunted like an underwater trophy kill.  

A vast majority of the submarine culture nurtures mis/disinformation. All aspects of the military and civilian culture have their own secrets. This AMA is dedicated to providing a means to ask questions in a manner that is safe and comfortable for all parties.

Operational security (OPSEC) is going to be maintained at the highest level to ensure the safety of everyone involved. Questions involving classified information will not be answered. I apologize before hand if your question doesn't get answered. Simple questions like "How deep can you dive?" or "How fast can you go underwater?" are usually classified. We get questioned about classified material all the time so don't hesitate to ask us anything. Everyone cleared to work with classified information is trained on how to deal with questions. The panel will answer questions as they see fit and follow any procedures required of them.

This AMA is going to stay at 100% active until tomorrow due to the time differences. Everyone involved is scattered across 6 different time zones. The active submariners have unreliable schedules due to the nature of the job. We also have a few people taking business flights today. Some replys maybe delayed due to this.
