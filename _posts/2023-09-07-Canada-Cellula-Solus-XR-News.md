# Cellula's Solus-XR XLUUV Hits The Water

![Flag](/images/flag_canada.jpg) The first images of Cellula's new autonomous underwater vehicle in the water [have surfaced](https://www.cellula.com/news/2023/8/30/cellula-robotics-ltd-initiates-sea-trials-of-its-solus-xr-system-marking-a-significant-project-milestone-and-demonstrating-commitment-to-cutting-edge-xluuv-technology). The Canadian company's Solus-XR is a long-range extra-large uncrewed underwater vehicle (XLUUV).   

The Solus-XR achieves it's impressive 2,700 nautical mile range by Cellula's hydrogen fuel cell propulsion. This has been proven in the company's Solus-LR vehicle. It also has a significant payload capability. The company advertises its roles as anti-submarine warfare (ASW), payload delivery, rapid environmental assessment and mine countermeasures.
