 **Spain's SAES Limpet Naval Mine (MILA) on board SEAL Carrier SDV**    
![Flag](/images/flag_spain.jpg) ![Flag](/images/flag_sweden.jpg) ![Flag](/images/flag_UK.jpg) SAES (S.A. Electrónica Submarina) recently revealed that they have integrated their MILA limpet mine into the JFD SEAL Carrier SDV.   

*” MILA is a smart limpet mine designed to be used for Special Forces, that incorporates a detonation system controlled by a computer.Minas Navales MILA-6C SAES It can be attached to the hull by a diver or be used as a demolition charge. Its conical shape and low weight in water endows the mine with a low hydrodynamic resistance, being easy to carry by divers. The limpet mine has successfully passed environmental test and extensive sea trials with excellent results against still targets of 12, 24 and 36 mm thickness. MILA is available in Exercise (reusable & inert) and Combat versions.”*

I am intending to do a write-up on current Limpet Mines at some point.

 **Rare R2 submersible on display**

This photo was in a local newspaper paper today. The caption reads *"as though taken straight from a Bond film, the R2 was brought from Yugoslavia when Sweden wanted to test her defenses during the Cold War in the 1980s."*

A single R1 one-man SDV was also purchased, and together they allowed the *A-Dyke* (‘attack diver’; Swedish naval Special Forces frogmen) to test Swedish naval defenses. They were generally successful. Today the A-Dyke operate several types of DPV and SDV, including the SEAL Carrier above.
