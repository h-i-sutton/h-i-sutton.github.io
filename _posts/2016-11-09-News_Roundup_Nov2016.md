**Russia sends a Raptor Assault boat to Syria**  
Russian ship KIL158 recently passed south from the Black Sea to Syria with a Project 03160 Raptor assault boat poorly camouflaged on the aft deck. OSINT observers correctly identified the load which was subsequently confirmed through other sources. [Alper Böler's Twitter](https://twitter.com/alperboler/status/794078736056537088)

The same ship was previously noted heading to Syria with two small boats onboard which were [at the time](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2016-05-08-Russian%20Assault%20Boats%20head%20to%20Syria %}) misidentified as assault boats.

**Narco-torpedo found on Irish beach**  
A narco-torpedo containing 65kg of cocaine was discovered on 24th October in Clare. The device must have home detached from its host vessel.
