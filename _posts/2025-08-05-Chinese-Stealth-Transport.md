# OSINT: Previously Unreported Low-Observable Naval Transport

![Flag China](/images/flag_China.jpg) A previously unreported Chinese transport vessel, with low-observable characteristics, has been observed in historic satellite imagery of Sanya on Hainan, in the South China Sea. The vessel is visible in Airbus imagery from October 5 2023 at 18.2215°, 109.5385°.   

Civilian multihull ferries are common in the port but these vessel appears to be a military transport, possibly optionally crewed.

The 21 meter vessel has a square bow suggesting a multi-hull, or possibly 'stiletto' hull. In fact there is a general likeness to the American M80 Stiletto, but with an open cargo area. The cargo area, which is a working deck but with raised sides, could provide cover for smaller boats or underwater vehicles. It also has a general resemblance to the AIRCAT Panther landing craft concept from American company [Eureka Naval Craft](https://www.eureka.navy/vessels/).

*M80 Stiletto for reference*  

The open-backed transport may be associated with China's XLUUV (extra-large uncrewed underwater vessel) program. The vessel is moored where some of the XLUUVs are tested. The XLUUVs have regularly been deployed there (and are at the moment), with a temporary hangar and road-mobile crane. But were not present at the time that the transport is there, so the connection is currently circumstantial.
