![Flag](/images/flag_netherlands.jpg) Dutch Swimmer Delivery Vehicle and Special Forces Diver technology company **Ortega** ([website](http://www.ortega-submersibles.com/)) have released a new video of their **Mk.1A** SDV being tested in Croatia. The clear waters and daytime testing allow incredible underwater photography rarely seen with military SDVs. Incredibly, the Mk.1A is based on the World War Two *Sleeping Beauty* SDV but with modern technology and refined hydrodynamics.
