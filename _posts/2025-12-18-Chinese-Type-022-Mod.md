#Chinese Navy (PLAN) Has Modified Two Type-022 FAC For Special Purpose![Flag China](/images/flag_China.jpg) Over the past few months two Type-022 missile boats have been converted to a new configuration at the People's Liberation Army Navy's (PLAN) Liaonan Shipyard in Lushun (formerly Port Arthur) in northern China. The vessels have had their distinctive missile bins removed and replaced by a larger box-like structure. This extends further aft than the previous superstructure.

*Sketch highlighting visible modifications (orange). Based on original Type-022 profile sketch by Manfred Meyer, [Modern Chinese Maritime Forces Second Edition](https://www.admiraltytrilogy.com/twochina.php).*  

The vessels have been visible in satellite imagery (vicinity 38.80230°, 121.26011°) and earlier leaked photos, but now a clearer photo is available via Chinese social media. This confirms much of the initial analysis based on the satellite imagery.   

The Type-022 Houbei class fast attack craft (FAC) are a stealthy design which entered service in 2004 as part of the first wave of China's naval modernisation. They are armed with eight YJ-83 sea-skimming subsonic anti-ship missiles (AShMs). Although appearing modern, even futuristic, these vessels have limited capabilities and are increasingly dated and overshadowed. It is thus unsurprising that some are being modernised to fulfill new roles.

*Reference photo of Type-022 FAC showing angled missile bins in aft superstructure. These have been replaced.*  

The new structure may allow the vessels to play a command & control (c2) role, or possibly for electromagnetic warfare (EW). Although there are hatches visible on the sides of the structure it does not appear to be a drone hangar, or for minelaying. A new large flat radome is positioned forward and slight to the port side of the structure. Two more antenna masts are added, one over the bridge on the port side and one in the aft starboard quarter.   

The role of these vessels, and whether more will be converted, remains to be seen. They are in the North Sea Fleet so caution is needed when trying to assess whether they indicate further preparations for the expected invasion of Taiwan.
