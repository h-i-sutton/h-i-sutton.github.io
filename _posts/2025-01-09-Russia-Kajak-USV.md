Limited information is available. Russian social media reporting suggests that it is intended for mine laying and has a combat load of 150 kg (which seems optimistic). It is likely propelled by an electric motor. Overall the design is generally sensible and useful.

Russia has developed a range of USVs, and is increasingly using them.
