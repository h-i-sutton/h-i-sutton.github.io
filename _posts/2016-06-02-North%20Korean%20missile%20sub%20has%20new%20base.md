*Original analysis: alternative suggestions welcome*

![Flag](/images/flag_nork.jpg)Recent TV footage from North Korea’s suggests that the country’s sole **Sinpo Class** ballistic missile submarine (SSB) has relocated from the quayside at the factory where it was built, to an isolated peer at a submarine base. Analysis suggests that the new base is the major submarine base on the island of *Mayang-do*.

Mayang-do is one of two major submarine bases along the East Coast of North Korea (the other being Ch'aho-nodongjagu) and is near to Sinpo where the submarine was built. This is the first evidence of the submarine venturing away from its builder’s quay and may indicate a shift in operational testing.

The Sinpo Class is North Korea’s first ballistic missile submarine and the largest submarine ever built in the country. It is however very small for a ballistic missile boat and can only carry a single missile tube which is located below the sail. The NK-11 “북극성-1” (Pukgeukseong-1 = 'North Star-1' = 'Polaris-1') missile is a clone of the Soviet era R-27 missile and is consequently likely to be much sorter ranged than submarine launched ballistic missiles used by most other nuclear powers.
