**OSINT Landscape released**  

This landscape shows the main platforms and tools of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) and Open Source Investigation (OSINV). OSINT is the collection and analysis of publicly available sources in an intelligence context. "Open" refers to overt, publicly available sources as opposed to covert or clandestine sources.

*Inclusion on this landscape does not constitute endorsement*  

The project is the result of a collaboration between OSINT analysts with differing areas of focus and differing methods and approaches. It is hopefully broadly applicable to a range of OSINT and OSINV applications.
