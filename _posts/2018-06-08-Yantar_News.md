The SeaEye Tiger ROV was supplied to Russia following the Kursk tragedy to aid deep sea rescue efforts. It can reach depths of 1,000 meters and is normally carried aboard the rescue ship **Igor Belousov**. It was lent to the Argentine Navy's patrol ship *ARA Islas Malvinas* (A-24), formerly a Russian tugboat *Neftegaz 57*, when she joined the international search for the Argentinean submarine ARA San Juan (S-42) which went missing on 15th November 2017. The system was then transferred to Yantar for transportation back to Russia. Note that some sources say the ROV was the closely related Panther-Plus not Tiger.

The system was loaded aboard Yantar some time after December 19th 2017. Yantar is fitted with two ROV systems which launch over the stern. Yet Russia switched to the British supplied system in the search for the Argentinean submarine.
