![Flag](/images/flag_RoK.jpg) A few years ago South Korean submarine builder Hyundai unveiled the stunning HDS-500 (aka KSS-500A) midget submarine design. This week Janes' reported that Hyundai had begun constructon of a 40m long midget submarine, the HDS-400, for an undisclosed customer. The new designation suggests that the submarine is slightly smaller than the HDS-500 design with a surface displacement of 400 tons. The reported length of 40m however hich is slightly longer than the HDS-500.   

Janes' article: [hyundai-begins-construction-of-mini-submarine-for-undisclosed-customer](http://www.janes.com/article/54825/hyundai-begins-construction-of-mini-submarine-for-undisclosed-customer)  

The customer is open to speculation. The HDS-500 was marketed to Thailand so the Royal Thai Navy (RTN) would be a reasonable guess, as would the South Korean Navy (ROKN). Additionaly Hyundai has a deal with an Indian shipyard concerning submarine technology and South Korea has submarine ties with Indonesia and Azerbaijan
