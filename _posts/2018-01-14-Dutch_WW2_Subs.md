**Advanced Dutch multi-hull submarine designs of World War Two**   

![Flag](/images/flag_netherlands.jpg) At the start of World war Two, naval architects from the Dutch B.V. Nederlandsche Ver. Scheepsbouw Bureaux took refuge in the United Kingdom, where they continued to design submarines. Although the designs remained unbuilt, the designs give us an interesting insight into the unique and innovative Dutch submarine design tradition.

Instead of a single pressure hull like *almost* all other submarines, the Dutch proposed five main tubular pressure hulls arranged in a cruciform with the main one running along the top, one below it at the front and back (with a break in the middle) and one running along each side. There was also a smaller pressure hull below the conning tower containing the captain’s cabin.

**Postwar Legacy**   

The post-war 3-cylinder Dolfijn/Potvis-class design clearly stems from these designs, with a three-hull arrangement within a smooth outer casing. The three hulls are arranged in a triangle with the main hull on top containing forward and aft torpedo rooms plus the main accommodation and control spaces, and the engines and batteries in the lower hulls.
