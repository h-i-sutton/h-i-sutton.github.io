# Ukrainian Special Forces Poloz-M16 Canoe

![Flag Ukraine](/images/flag_ukraine.jpg) Ukrainian armed forces have been shown testing an indigenous motorized canoe, the Poloz-M16. The two-person design is not typical of military canoes which are most often of the folding kayak type. Instead it is a hard hull type with hard deck and soft covers, and an electric motor at the stern. The crew can also use double-ended kayak style paddles.  

Poloz-M16 is produced by Adamant Shipyard. The canoe was seen armed with a single locally designed UAG-40 40mm grenade launcher. The 18kg weapon has light recoil, making mounting practical. it is compatible with NATO 40mm grenade ammunition. Range is reported at 1.5-2km.  

It is unclear whether the canoe will enter service.
