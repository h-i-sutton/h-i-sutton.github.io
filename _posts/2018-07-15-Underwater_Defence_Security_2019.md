I gave two talks at this year's show, UDS-2018, one on the Russian Submarine **Belgorod** and related KANYON and Seabed Warfare topics, and one on Open Source Intelligence (**OSINT**). The event was well attended and with very interesting talks. An interview I gave prior to the talks [HERE](http://www.underwater-defence-security.com/stay-hunting-avoid-being-hunted.php)

I have heard that TKN may also run a submarine focused event later this year. Stay tuned.
