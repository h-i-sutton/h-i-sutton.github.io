I got this quiz idea while preparing recognition silhouettes for [WORLD SUBMARINES: Covert Shores Recognition Guide](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1541392302)  

Some of the silhouettes in this quiz are a bit crude, please forgive me. Anyway I thought that it’s a cool test of Cold War memories.   

(If you like challenging yourself then try [assault rifle quiz 1](assault-rifle-quiz-1.html) and [assault rifle quiz 2](assault-rifle-quiz-2.html)!)

This quiz needs Javacsript.
