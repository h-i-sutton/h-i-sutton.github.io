#OSINT: China's New Type-075 Assault Carrier On Sea Trials![Flag China](/images/flag_China.jpg) China has taken another small step forward. Videos shared online have shown the commencement of sea trials for their third assault carrier. The Type-075 was moved away from its fitting-out pier by two tugs on November 25. Videos soon emerged of it leaving Shanghai ([example, Twitter](https://twitter.com/sugar_wsnbn/status/1464816131282128902)).   

Sentinel-2 satellite imagery as confirmed it at sea on November 26.

This is the 3rd Type-075 LHD, all built at the same yard in Shanghai. Currently a Type-071 LPD is being built there, along with several Type-054A frigates. The LPD may be the export model Type-071E for Thailand, which was [ordered in 2019](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2019/09/royal-thai-navy-procures-type-071e-lpd-from-chinas-cssc/). And the Frigates may be Type-054A/P versions for Pakistan.

It is possible that the Type-075, although still a brand new capability for the PLAN, will soon be supplemented by the improved Type-076. That may be closer to the US Navy's America Class assault carriers.
