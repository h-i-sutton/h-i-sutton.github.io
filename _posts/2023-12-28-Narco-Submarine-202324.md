#Unusual Narco-Submarine Interdicted Off ColombiaThe year end often sees a seasonal spike in narco-submarine activity. The Colombian military interdicted an LPV (low profile vessel) in the Pacific on December 24. The vessel was carrying 1,678 kilos of cocaine with an estimated value of $56,000,000.   

The design is unusual, being the first seen with a raised bow. There is a step down about halfway along the side. This is likely intended to improve seakeeping.

*Even with the raised bow, the vessel is still incredibly low in the water making it hard to see.*  

It is a form of low-profile-vessel with outboard motors and a very slender hull (LPV-OM-VSV). Although there are some similarities to the LPV-OM-VSV-8 design, there are enough differences to indicate that it is an entirely new family. This is therefore categorized as LPV-OM-VSV-11 in the Covert Shores taxonomy.  

Another unusual feature is that apparently there were four crew aboard. LPVs with outboard motors typically have three crew.
