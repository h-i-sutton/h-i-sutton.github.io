#OSINT: China Censors Numbers On Navy Plane![Flag China](/images/flag_China.jpg) Chinese media post some excellent photographs of Chinese Navy (PLAN) equipment. But one photo shoot of Y-8Q maritime patrol aircraft (MPAs) was digitally altered to hide the number. Eagle-eyed OSINT analyst [Evergreen Intel](https://twitter.com/vcdgf555/status/1376946632894205952) spotted it.  

This is only tangential to my normal focus but I thought it is interesting so hope you agree that it is worth sharing.   

The photo series dates back to at least April 2020 but appears to be being published again now. The missing number is likely to be an '8', making the aircraft's number '86'. This aircraft has been photographed before and is on [www.airliners.net](https://www.airliners.net/photo/China-Navy/Shaanxi-Y-8Q-KQ-200-GX6/5769349/L).

*Double-digit numbers '85', '86' and '88' have all been observed. No aircraft with single digit numbers however.*

*It should also be noted that PLAN Y-8Qs do often have their numbers painted over. Here '82038' is just visible on the tail.*

*Y-8Q, also known as the KQ-200. It is suspected that the tail number has been altered on this image.*  

Although the articles only stated that the Y-8Q aircraft are part of "PLA Southern Theater Command" I have geolocated the images to Baishatu, Qionghai on the island of Hainan. This provides them with easy access to the South China Sea.
