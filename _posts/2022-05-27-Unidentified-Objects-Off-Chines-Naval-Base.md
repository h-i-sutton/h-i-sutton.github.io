#Mystery Objects Off Chinese Coast, Near Special Base![Flag China](/images/flag_China.jpg) I, with others, have been observing this site for some time. There are four unexplained pillars or buoys just off the coast of Dalian, China. They are now visible on Google Earth as well.  

They are adjacent to a pier which is used by Chinese navy submarines and [special research projects](https://news.usni.org/2021/10/11/chinese-testing-experimental-armed-drone-ships-at-secret-naval-base). These include their uncrewed surface vessel (USV) programs.   

The purpose of these four objects is unclear. There is evidence that their placement was carefully surveyed beforehand, and they are neatly aligned.   

Possibly they protect another object which is below the surface. But there are no visible booms between them. Alternatively, possibly they are a marker for uncrewed surface or subsurface vehicles during tests. Or relate to underseas sensor networks.

The area was surveyed in December 2019 by the catamaran marine survey ship, 991. Based on a combination of different satellite images, it remained there several days. The objects were then placed in March-April 2021, over the course of a few weeks, The vessels involved operated from the nearby pier of interest.

The four objects are arranged in a rectangle, aligned north-south. They are about 150 meters (490 ft) apart east-west and 250 meters (820 ft) north-south. No unusual activity has been observed around them since they were placed there. There are no additional markers or cordon.
