*I miss the fantastic artworks which accompanied DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) reports on Soviet developments in the 1980s. Artists such as Edward L. Cooper and Brian W. McMullin really brought the new equipment to life.*   

As well as making the reports interesting and accessible to the less well versed masses, and capturing the imagination of a generation of boys (myself included!), these served to protect the sources behind the reports. Illustrations of submarines, tans, lasers, space weapons and warships filled the reader's mind. For me the illustrations by Edward L. Cooper were particularly powerful and i was heavily influenced by this when I did my recent illustration of the SinpoClass SSB firing a missile [here](/images/SinpoLaunch2000.jpg "here")
