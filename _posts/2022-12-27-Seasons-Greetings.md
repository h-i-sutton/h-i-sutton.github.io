  Season's greetings. 2022 has seen the Covert Shores blog (and Twitter) focusing
  on the naval aspects of the war in Ukraine. I will continue this focus as long as
  the fighting continues. I hope to return to submarine cutaways (there are several
  completed but unpublished) and the varied diet of obscure naval topics again in
  2023. For the moment, I am playing it by ear however.<br/><br/>Please be aware that
  my books are no longer in print.<br/>

#Season's Greetings & Update on BooksSeason's greetings.   

2022 has seen the Covert Shores blog (and Twitter) focusing on the naval aspects of the war in Ukraine. I will continue this focus as long as the fighting continues. I hope to return to submarine cutaways (there are several completed but unpublished) and the varied diet of obscure naval topics again in 2023. For the moment, I am playing it by ear however.  

##UpdatePlease be aware that my books are no longer in print.
