# New Ukrainian Navy USV Sees Action In Black Sea

![Flag Ukraine](/images/flag_ukraine.jpg) Commander of the Ukrainian Navy (VMS ZSU), Vice-Admiral Oleksiy Neizhpapa, [shared a video](https://x.com/UA_NAVY/status/1865283723043684787) of a new surface drone (USV- uncrewed surface vessel) being used in the Black Sea. The USV is shown targeting Russian occupied gas platforms. These platforms have been repeatedly fought over and used by both sides. The USV is a new type not previously seen in public.   

It appears that the new USV can carry FPV aerial drones (UAVs). At first sight the vessel has an unusual trimaran configuration with large sponson/outriggers each side, however these may be clamshell doors to the UAV hangar.

There are three impact detonators arranged on the bow, and the aft is covered in a hooped canvas. This is possibly to reduce the infrared signature. Curiously the boat appears to reverse into the rigs on occasion, possibly hinting at a novel warhead.
