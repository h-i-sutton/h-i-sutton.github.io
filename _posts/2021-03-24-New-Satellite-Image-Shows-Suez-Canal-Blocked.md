# Seen From Space: Suez Canal Blocked

All eyes are on the container ship which blocked the Suez Canal. This includes the eyes in space. Sentinel 2 satellite imagery, taken today, gives a new perspective on the problem. Best summed up by [@AuroraIntel (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/AuroraIntel/status/1374664149096144896)  

The Ever Given (IMO 9811000) became grounded on March 23. It is still there, literally blocking the canal. An armada of tugs are attempting to shift it. They are also visible on MarineTraffic.com's AIS (Automated Information System) views:
