# 2 'New' Russian USVs at ARMY-2024

![Flag Russia](/images/flag_russia.jpg) Russia has displayed at least two 'new' uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) at the ARMY-2024 defense expo. Actually, one is new, the other is a rebranding of a type seen earlier this year.   

## Murena-300S - Combat USV

The Murena-300S appears generally comparable with Ukrainian types. The Murena (Moray Eel) is approximately the same size as the Ukrainian Magura V5 and Sea Navy designs. According to specifications shared at the Army-2024 defense show it has a top speed of 45 knots. It has a range of 500 km, but appears intended for inshore missions more than open water operations. The producer, LLC KB Center for Unmanned Systems, advertises it for Defense of Naval facilities, mine laying, mine clearance, patrolling and reconnaissance. It is also supposed to perform fire support of ground operations from the sea. Realistically its claimed 500kg payload could translate into a large explosive charge.  

The vessel has a simple metal semi-planing powerboat hull similar to the classic Soviet-era ‘Progress’ series. This is combined with a relatively low profile superstructure. Unlike most, but not all, Ukrainian designs it has an outboard motor. There are some signs that the vessel displayed is crudely constructed. It is unclear whether this is straightforward poor workmanship, or simply an expediency for a one-way vessel. This may make it more vulnerable to defensive gunfire. USV combat is not a beauty contest.

Significantly, it appears to have a Starlink antenna. The apparent antenna as been hidden under camouflage netting but its distinctive shape is evident. The corners of the square antenna are also just visible in photographs from the event.

**UPDATE**. On September 19 2024 the Murena was displayed to President Putin while armed with UMT 220mm lightweight torpedoes (in dummy form).

## Zefir - mine laying USV

The 'Zefir' was on display but hidden under a camo net. Possibly this was to hide the fact that it was not new, but rather the previously displayed 'Orcan' type. The yellow paint and distinctive features showed through. Back in June it was presented as a basic platform for robotic marine systems. It is now presented as an inshore minelaying system.  

It is similar in size to the USVs used by Ukraine and has a single waterjet drive.  

**Zefir / Orcan USV Specifications:**  

Length: 5.3 m  

Beam: 1.7 m  

Height: 0.8 m  

Speed: 15 kt  

Endurance: 6 hours  

Payload: 100 liters
