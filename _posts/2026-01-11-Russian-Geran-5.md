![Flag Russia](/images/flag_russia.jpg)  Ukraine reports that Russia has used the new Geran-5 (*Geran* = geranium) missile-drone against targets in the country. Photos of a crashed example have been widely shared. 

The Geran-5 can be seen as part of a wider trend to make low-cost jet powered drones which bridge the gap between drones and missiles.  Ukraine has several designs and Russia has already fielded a simple jet turbine variant of the ubiquitous Geran-2 (Shahed) piston drone. The Geran-5 is likely a step up from that, being likely faster and longer ranged.

The missile has a reported length of 6 meters, payload of 90 kg (suggesting a standard larger-size Shahed/Geran-2 warhead) and a range of 1,000 km. This makes it significantly larger than many drone-missiles, yet still smaller and shorter ranged than Ukraine’s [FP-5 Flamingo missile](https://www.hisutton.com/Ukrainian-FP-15-Flamingo-Cruise-Missile.html). 

The fuselage is cylindrical with numerous panels and features suggesting missile-style construction more than typical drone methods.  This means that it is likely more expensive, but can withstand higher performance and may be lighter, and thus convey greater range and speed. The wings are a simple unwept and untampered form, and the tail uses a bomber-style ‘H’ arrangement with endplate rudders. This allows the jet turbine to be attached above the fuselage and the launch booster below.

## Not An Iranian Karrar clone

Parallels have been drawn to Iran’s Karrar combat drone which has a similar overall configuration and six. That weapon is a more refined airframe (thus likely more expensive) and, notably, carries its payload under the fuselage, making it reusable. If the Geran-5 is a one-way drone then similarities to the Karrer are likely coincidental. Several Ukrainian low-cost cruise missiles share a similar overall form.
