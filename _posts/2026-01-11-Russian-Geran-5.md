![Flag Russia](/images/flag_russia.jpg)  Ukraine reports that Russia has used the new Geran-5 (*Geran* = geranium) missile-drone against targets in the country. Photos of a crashed example have been widely shared which provide us with our first look at the airframe. 

The Geran-5 can be seen as part of a wider trend to make low-cost jet powered drones which bridge the gap between drones and missiles.  Ukraine has several designs and Russia has already fielded a simple jet turbine variant of the ubiquitous Geran-2 (Shahed) piston drone. The Geran-5 is likely a step up from that, being both faster and longer ranged.

The missile has a reported length of 6 meters, payload of 90 kg (suggesting a standard larger-size Shahed/Geran-2 warhead) and a range of 1,000 km. This makes it significantly larger than many similar drone-missiles, yet smaller and shorter ranged than Ukraine’s [FP-5 Flamingo missile](https://www.hisutton.com/Ukrainian-FP-15-Flamingo-Cruise-Missile.html). 

The fuselage is cylindrical with numerous features suggesting missile-style metal construction more than typical drone airframe.  This likely means that it is more expensive than the Shahed/Geran-2, but can withstand higher stresses and may be lighter. This would convey greater range and speed. Having said that the wings are a simple unwept and untampered form, which suggests still only modest speeds overall. The tail uses a bomber-style arrangement with endplate rudders which allows the jet turbine to be attached above the fuselage and the launch booster below.

## Not An Iranian Karrar clone

Parallels have been drawn to Iran’s **Karrar** combat drone which has a similar overall configuration. The Karrar has nan even more aircraft-like airframe which logically makes it even more expensive. And notably, the Karrar carries its payload under the fuselage, making it reusable. If the Geran-5 is a one-way drone then similarities to the Karrer are just coincidental; several Ukrainian low-cost drone-missiles also share a similar overall form yet are unrelated.
