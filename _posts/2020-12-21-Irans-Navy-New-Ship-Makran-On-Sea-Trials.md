#Iranian Navy's largest Ship, I.R.I.N.S Makran, Observed On Sea Trials![](/images/flag_iran.jpg) The Iranian Navy is joining the IRGC in converting large merchant ships to function as Forward Base Ships. The Iranian Navy's version, the **I.R.I.N.S. Makran (441)**, is by far the largest. As  [previously reported](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2020-11-29-Iranian-Forward-Base-Ships %}) it was floated in November. From at least December 9-14 it was on sea trials in the general vicinity of the Straits of Hormuz.

The Forward Base ships are similar in concept to the expeditionary mobile base (EMB). In terms of overall dimensions it is approximately the same size as the U.S> Navy's USS Lewis B. Puller (ESB-3).
