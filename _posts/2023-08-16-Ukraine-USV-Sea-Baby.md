#Sea Baby: The Ukrainian Navy's 'Bridge Killer' Maritime Drone![Flag Ukraine](/images/flag_ukraine.jpg) The July 17 attack on the Kerch Bridge is one of the more successful, and noteworthy, maritime drone attacks. Now, via an [exclusive with CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/08/15/europe/ukraine-crimea-bridge-drone-strike-video-intl/index.html), the Ukrainian government has revealed more details about the drones used.

The USV (uncrewed surface vessel) is a previously unseen variation. Given the nickname 'Sea Baby', the design features a new hull design with a rising skiff-like bow. More significantly, yet unseen, it may have been equipped with a special warhead. Reports indicate a 860kg warhead, much larger than the other models.

*A) External containers, possibly for additional fuel. B) Radome, likely for communications. C) Electro-optical device.*  

It is unclear whether this is the latest variant, or specific to the bridge mission. Available images suggest that at least 5 of this design have been built. And at least two have been expended attacking the Kerch Bridge. However imagery of attacks on ships generally show different models.
