**SDV-1000W submersible boat**   
![Flag](/images/flag_RoK.jpg) South Korea gained awareness of the utility of submersible boats for special forces and agent insertion / extraction because North Korea has used them against the South. Several have been captured or sunk & retrieved over the years and South Korean Special Operations Command even operated a copy of a basic North Korean design. Additionally there was a good awareness of the British Subskimmer design which uses a RIB (Rigid Inflatable Boat) hull, unlike the more conventional North Korean designs. The South Korean SDV-1000W therefore combines aspects of both families, together with some features which are peculiar to the Vogo design.

The prototype SDV-1000W under construction at Vogo Engineering. Note the pop-out thrusters for underwater propulsion and steering. Unlike the early model SubSkimmers, the inflatable tube is in a hard collar which improves underwater hydrodynamics (the most recent SubSkimmers also feature this).

The SDV-1000W is a shore-to-shore platform which can travel on the surface for up to 150 nautical miles without refueling. The last portions of the mission, as it enters the *discrete zone* within radar range of the target coast, is conducted with the boat submerged. This is either with its snorkel (thus it can still run the -diesel engine), or running on batteries for increased stealth.  

When submerged it is a wet sub, with the crew having to wear diving gear. There is a large-capacity onboard air system so the divers can conserve their personal breathing apparatus. This allows them to exit the craft and swim ashore. In some circumstances the SDV-1000W can simply be run up the beach like a landing craft.

Like the latest generation of high performance special forces surface craft, the crew and passengers are seated on shock-absorbing seats capable to supporting them during hull drops of 8G. This is important to prevent injuries during high speed travel and is likely a factor in allowing the SDV-1000W to have a significantly higher surface speed than some other submersible boat designs.
