The Interspiro **IS-MIX** (aka **OMD 10**) is one of the latest generation of Western semi-closed circuit mixed-gas rebreathers. Being one of the most advanced on the market it is used by several NATO Navies and the Swedish Navy's Clearance Divers (aka Navy EOD, aka **'Röjdykare'**). And therefore it isn't the type of kit which is available on the civilian market, and sets naval applications apart from civilian ones. Consequently only minimal information is available in the public domain.

The biggest concern in diving is always safety; diving is inherently dangerous and the deeper you go, the longer, the colder the water, the further from shore... all these factors only make reliability even more important. But when you throw high-explosive naval mines with magnetic or acoustic fuses and anti-tamper devices into the mix, the danger goes off the scale. Go near them in regular SCUBA gear and you'd be liquidized. You need a rig that is non-magnetic and silent (no bubbles, no breathing sound...), and that doesn't come cheaply.   

So the IS-MIX is tailor made to the mine clearance role, something which technologically-speaking is more challenging than covert special forces missions. It is suited to those mission profiles (ship attack, reconnaissance, infiltration), but in some regards is over-specification and therefore expensive.
