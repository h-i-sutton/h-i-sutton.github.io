#Drass SDVs and submarines[![](/images/Drass_logo.jpg)](http://drass.it)![Flag](/images/flag_italy.jpg) It seems probable that Italian firm Drass is behind the construction of two new submarines for Qatar. The exact model is unclear but they are likely to be in the 'compact' or 'midget' categories of Drass' range.   

The secrecy surrounding Italian Swimmer Delivery Vehicle (SDV) manufacture is legendary. Drass are an established name in the defense industry supplying hyperbaric chambers for diver decompression. They also offer a range of SDVs and midget submarines which are the evolution of the previous Cos.Mo.S designs. Their connection to Cos.Mo.S has been known in relevant circles but it is only very recently that they went public with their new-build SDV offering.   
![Drass SDVs - Covert Shores](/images/DRASS-Table.jpg)  
*Quick reference table to DRASS and historical Cos.Mo.S types. In all cases DRASS designs have been updated.*  

Before involvement with the Cos.Mo.S designs, Drass (formerly Roberto Galeazzi) had previously designed SDVs:

*From Drass* [website](http://www.drass.it)

Based in La Spezia, conveniently near to the Italian naval Special Forces (COMSUBIN), Drass were close neighbors of Cos.Mo.S during the time that the latter was a major midget submarine and SDV exporter. So it is not entirely Surprising that Drass have taken over the Cos.Mo.S designs after they went out of business (see notes [HERE]({% post_url 2016-02-29-The%20famous%20CosMoS%20CE2F%20chariot %})). Although the fundamental designs are established classics from Cos.Mo.S, Drass has incorporated up to date lithium-ion battery technology, a new control and navigation module and the latest generation of sensors.

##DG-900 Compact Submarine![Drass submarines - Covert Shores](/images/Italy-Drass-DG900.jpg)  
The DG900 is the largest design in the compact submarine range. As the name implies, it displaces 900 tons. The operational is that the submarine is large enough to function as a regular patrol submarine, yet still compact enough to operate in the special inshore roles. Relative to Drass' smaller types it offers improved underwater performance, endurance and armament.   

The most distinctive feature is its novel sail design with sculptured forward surfaces and the dive planes mounted relatively far aft. This contains several non-penetrating masts including a DRASS optronic mast. The hull uses a double-hull construction but with the pressure hull frames on the inside. This unusual arrangement is the evolution of the Cos.Mo.S midget submarines design. At the stern new X-form control surfaces lead to a large-diameter basic pump jet.   

Inside it is comparatively traditional, at least compared to the smaller Drass designs. There are six 533mm (21 inch) torpedo tubes in the bow. These enter a torpedo room with capacity for two reloads. And two additional torpedoes can be mounted under the casing in external tubes. Beneath the tubes is a modest cylindrical array sonar.   

In common with other Drass types the design emphasizes minimum crew needs. It is also able to host AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles) and SDVs (Swimmer Delivery Vehicles). Drass builds both.   

##DG-550 Compact Submarine![Drass DG-550 submarine - Covert Shores](/images/Italy-Drass-DG-550-Compact-Submarine.jpg)  
This design has a similar overall form to earlier Drass / Cos.Mo.S designs but with some enhancements similar to the DG-900. These include new non-penetrating masts and X-form rudders.   

At least one DG-550 is under construction.   

##DG-450 Shallow-water Attack Submarine![Drass DG-450 submarine - Covert Shores](/images/Drass_DG450.jpg)  
The largest type in the DRASS line up, the 450 ton DG-450 is significantly larger than any reported Cos.Mo.S designs. It can carry two 6-man SDVs and three heavyweight torpedoes making a truly multi-role platform in littoral waters.

##DG-160 Shallow-water Attack Submarine![Drass SDVs - Covert Shores](/images/DRASS_DG160_schematic1.jpg)  
The 140 ton DG-160 is reminiscent of the unbuilt Cos.Mo.S **X-201** SWATS submarine concept but with a more conventional ‘+’ tail section based on the MG-120 design.

##DG-120 Shallow-water Attack SubmarineThe DG-120 sacrifices Special Forces payload for a larger complement of wire-guided 400mm torpedoes with 11 nautical miles range. Only two commandos can be carried in addition to the seven-person crew.

![Drass SDVs - Covert Shores](/images/DRASS_DG120_schematic.jpg)  

##DG-100 Compact SubmarineThis design bears a passing resemblance to the Russian Piranha design. This is because it carries its torpedo tubes in the unusual should position. Overall it is similar to the DG-550 and DG-900 but scaled down to just 100 tons.   
![Drass submarines - Covert Shores](/images/Italy-Drass-DG100.jpg)  

##DG-85 Shallow-water Attack SubmarineThe smallest of the DRASS midget submarine designs, the DG-85 is intended for a) attacks on ships moored in harbor or harbor installation using the 6 mines which are carried externally, b) patrol of coastal areas as deterrent against enemy ships approaching own coastal targets using 400mm wire-guided torpedoes, c) Intelligence gathering using acoustic, electronic and communication (SIGNIT) sensors, and d) deployment of mines in very shallow waters / harbor mouths.  
![Drass SDVs - Covert Shores](/images/DRASS_DG85a.jpg)

##DG2-EN 2-man SDV![Drass SDVs - Covert Shores](/images/Drass_DG2_3d.jpg)  
The DG2 EN design is a direct evolution of the Cos.Mo.S CE2F X100 design and is intended purely as an offensive system to carry two combat swimmers From a host submarine (or vessel) to within range of their enemy ships in port or at anchor.   

Main article: [![](/images/CE2F_250.png)]({% post_url 2016-02-29-The%20famous%20CosMoS%20CE2F%20chariot %})[Cos.Mo.S CE2F]({% post_url 2016-02-29-The%20famous%20CosMoS%20CE2F%20chariot %}) chariot   

![Drass SDVs - Covert Shores](/images/Drass_DG2_cutaway.jpg)  
The hull is still recognizable as the CE2F but is rearranged with the crew air bottles moved inside the hull (not below the hull) and the belly payload removed. This is similar to the Cos.Mo.S CE3F design which was produced for South Korea. And like the CE3F, the canopy structure has lost its ‘head and shoulders’ cross-section. The payload is carried behind the crew in a locker on the back of the boat.   

**DG2 EN Specification**   
Length: 7.56 m  
Width: 0.8 m without hydroplanes  
Height: 1.3 m  
Weight (dry): 2.4 tons  
Crew: 2   
Range: 80 nm   
Speed: 4.8 kt max, 3.5 kt cruising  
Operating depth: TBC   
Host submarine transit depth: 100m   
Payload: Special Forces stores or 6 limpet mines carried in locker on back of craft

##DS4 4-man SDVThe DS4 is a minimal evolution of the Cos.Mo.S CE4F project for the Turkish Navy's SAT (Su Altı Taarruz) in the late-1990s to early-2000s.  
![Drass SDVs - Covert Shores](/images/Drass_DS4_3D.jpg)  

The design does not have some of the post-delivery alterations which were added to the CE4F (see below) but does have the additional stabilizers running along the lower hull.

##DS6 6-man SDVThe DS6 is Drass’ answer to the 6-man SDV market which is dominated by US, French and British designs. This allows a team of four Special Forces operators to be transported for a cross-beach mission.  
![Drass SDVs - Covert Shores](/images/Drass_DS6_cutaway.jpg)  
Analogous to the unbuilt Cos.Mo.S CE6F design, the DS6 is a lengthened DS4 with an additional row of diver’s sitting in the rear compartment. The air supply is increased but otherwise most systems remain the same, leading to a slight compromise in performance to accommodate the extra passengers.   

**DS6 Specification**   
Length: 9.1 m  
Width: 1.44 m hull diameter, 2.16 m max with hydroplanes  
Height: TBC  
Weight (dry): 3.66 tons  
Crew: 2 + 4 PAX  
Range: 70 nm   
Speed: 7 kt max, 5 kt cruising  
Operating depth: 50 m   
Host submarine transit depth: 100m   
Payload: Two sealed containers for Special Forces stores or limpet mines. Provision for 8 mini-torpedoes.  

##DS8 8-man SDVThe SDV carried is likely to be the Drass DS-8 which is generally analogues to the US Navy's SDV Mk.VIII Mod-0 and newer Mk.XI. It is larger than the rival Italian Deep Shadow from CABI Cattaneo.   

This 9 meter long wet-sub can transport 8 combat swimmers 60 nautical miles at depths of up to 30 meters (100 meters transit depth). It is 1.42 meters wide and capable of 7 knots.   
![Drass submarines - Covert Shores](/images/Italy-Drass-DS-8-SDV.jpg)  
*DS-8 SDV. Image, Drass*  

The design was previously shown with a cruciform tail similar to the DS6, but is now illustrated with the X-form control surfaces.
