# China's Continues Massive Construction At Key Navy Base In South China Sea

![Flag China](/images/flag_China.jpg) A major new construction has been taking place at Sanya on Hainan. The new site, being built out into the bay, is opposite a large dry dock which was only recently commissioned. It is part of a complex of facilities in the area which are the main naval base for the Chinese Navy (PLAN) in the South China Sea.

It is unclear whether the new construction is two very large piers, like those used for China's aircraft carriers, or a dry dock. Work was visible in June 2022 but has progressed rapidly in the last month. The new facility, whatever it is, is at least 230 meters across. It currently juts out 200 meters from the shore and may get larger.
