#Taiwan's Black Whale XLUUV![Flag](/images/flag_taiwan.jpg) China (PRC) is racing ahead with numerous extra-large extra-large uncrewed underwater vehicles (XLUUVs), [many of which are armed](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2025/09/chinas-new-giant-underwater-drone-increases-naval-mine-threat-around-taiwan/). Their principle target, at least in the collective consciousness, is Taiwan (ROC). A blockade and/or invasion is expected and looks increasingly likely. Vastly out-gunned and unsure of its allies, Taiwan is rapidly trying to create asymmetrical ways to counter the invasion threat. Principly these include uncrewed systems, many inspired by Ukraine's defence against Russia.   

Taiwanese shipbuilder Longteh Shipbuilding has revealed the '**Black Whale**' XLUUV at the TADTE2025 (Taipei Aerospace & Defense Technology Exhibition) exhibition in Taipai.

Black Whale closely resembles the British MSUBS 'Manta' XLUUV, but with an X-form rudder and simple screw arrangement. Reports suggest that an unnamed British firm is involved (possibly MSUBS), and that the vessel will be used for anti-submarine (ASW) and mine hunting. More offensive roles can also be imagined.   

**Provisional Specifications**  
Length 9 m (30 ft)   
Beam 2 m (6.5 ft)   
Weight 9 tonnes
