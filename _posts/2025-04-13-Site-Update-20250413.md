#Covert Shores Updating To HTTPSThis site will be updated to HTTPS standard. This is long over-due, and may take some days/weeks to reconfigure, please bear with me.  

HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. It is a more secure version of the HTTP protocol used for web communication, ensuring encrypted data transfer between a web browser and a website server. Essentially, HTTPS provides an additional layer of security by encrypting the communication between the user and the website. This is now standard, but the site needs migrating.  

Normal articles will resume shortly.
