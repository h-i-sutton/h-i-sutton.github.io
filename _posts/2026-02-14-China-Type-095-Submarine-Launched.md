The first Type-09V (095) class submarine has been launched at Huludao on China’s Bohai Sea. The large boat represents a new generation of attack submarine for the Chinese Navy (PLAN – People’s Army Liberation Navy). 

China is rapidly closing the submarine technology gap. Chinese submarines have generally been thought of as decades behind both the US (/UK) and Russia, a sentiment which still rings true in some aspects. But China has progressed and current broader assessment of nuclear-powered attack submarines would be much closer. It is both challenging and somewhat subjective to compare such submarines. What we can say with some confidence is that the Type-09V is China’s bid to further close the gap in overall terms, and exceed rivals in some aspects.

The boat is characterized by prominent X-form rudders. The dive planes are not clearly visible so might be the retractable type mounted near the bow. Details such as sonar and whether it is single or double hulled have yet to be ascertained. 

Although larger than the preceding Type-09III (093) class due to its larger diameter hull, the submarine is shorter than expected. Its overall length, estimated at between 105 and 110 meters, is about the same as the -09III. It was expected to be longer to allow for a larger bank of vertical launch tubes, possibly of a larger diameter. Due to its modest length, we can guess that the Type-09V has a VLS of perhaps 12-16 missiles. This is far fewer than the VLS capacity of the Russian Pr.885 SEVEROVINSK Class or U.S. Navy’s lengthened Virginia Class. 

For the Chinese boats these could however be hypersonic anti-ship missiles such as the YJ-17 or YJ-20, both of which seem larger in diameter than the standard 533mm (21 inch) torpedo size. This would make the vessel a significant threat to enemy ships, regardless of whether fewer or more missiles are carried.

In addition the boats likely have a large torpedo stowage compartment (aka torpedo room), possibly with up to 40 weapons like other boats with this hull diameter. But submarine design is full of compromises so many of these details may remain estimates for some years yet.
