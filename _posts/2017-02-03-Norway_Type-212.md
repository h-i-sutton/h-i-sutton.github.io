It will be the third TKMS designed submarine to operate with the Norwegian navy, replacing the Ula Class which was preceded by the Kobben (Type-207) Class. The Type-212 is currently only operated by Germany where it is sometimes known as U-212 Class, and Italy where it is known as the Todaro Class. It is a relatively small submarine well suited to inshore missions along the Norwegian coast but not best suited to under-ice operations. It has Air Independent Power (AIP) using two HDW/Siemens PEM fuel cells each with 120 kW.
