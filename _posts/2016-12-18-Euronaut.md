The architects and builders of these projects deserve the greatest respect and secret envy. The **Euronaut**, which has been built for wreck diving, is an incredible example of this rare breed.<br/><a href="/Euronaut.html"><img src="/images/Euronaut900.jpg"/></a><br/><a href="/Euronaut.html"><img src="/images/Euronaut_model900.jpg"/></a>

Very large by civilian standards, the Euronaut is relatively sophisticated and heavily built, able to dive to an impressive 250m (test depth 320m). The sub will operate with a 5 person crew for up to 7 days before surfacing.   

**Project website:** [euronaut.org](http://euronaut.org/) - masses of info and photos. And on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/euronaut.org/)

**Above:** a vital feature not to be underestimated on a midget submarine. The guidance might be misleading.   

**Diver's chamber**  

The diver’s chamber can be pressurized much higher than the rest of the crew area remains at 1 bar (ambient pressure), and has been tested to 32 bar.

**Above:** Another view of the diver’s lock-out chamber with the moon pool in the bottom, this time looking in through the hatch from the Control Room. There are two bunks in this space and it can be used for diver compression/decompression.

**Wreck hunting**  

![Euronaut](/images/Euronaut_seehund.jpg)  
**Above:** A side-scan sonar image of the wreck of a German Seehund two man midget submarine from World War Two in the Baltic. The Euronaut has its own onboard side scan sonar, and the crew anyway includes successful wreck hunters with a back catalogue of wreck finds, particularly of submarines (S.M. UC71, HMS E-16, H.M.S. Seahorse).

**Above:** View of the bow showing the three underwater lamps. The lens above them are underwater cameras with the larger one being HDTV. Another forward facing underwater lamp is mounted on the sail. The pinhole in the very nose is a forward facing sonar, and there is a side scan sonar below it (not visible).

**Construction**  

![Euronaut](/images/Euronaut_construction.jpg)  
**Above and below:** The Euronaut really was built in the yard of a house. Not quite a garage - it's too large, but it still counts as one f the most incredible garage-builds imaginable.
