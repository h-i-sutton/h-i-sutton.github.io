**Unbuilt Russian rescue submarine to replace INDIA Class**   
![Russian Spy subs GUGI - Covert Shores](/images/Ru_GUGI_1.jpg)   
*Model at Naval Show in St. Petersburg, 2015.*  

![Flag](/images/flag_russia.jpg) Russian design bureau Lazurit (Лазурит) may be pitching for a new role for their SIERRA Class attack submarines which were built during the Cold War - as rescue subs. This concept first came to light at the Naval Show in St. Petersburg, 2015. It is interesting partly because Lazurit has been out of the submarine business since the Cold War. Based on patent information (below) this concept is a conversion kit to use an existing nuclear powered attack submarine as a rescue submarine / host submarine. It would therefore replace the retired Project 940 *Lenok* Class (проект 940 ленок / INDIA Class) which was also designed by Lazurit.

*Cold War US DoD artist's impression of the INDIA Class rescuing a sunken November Class SSN.*  

The hull is clearly a Project 945 SIERRA Class (проект 945) SSN which has a titanium hull. Wet hangars are mounted in a wide whale-back which also encases the sail.

**Patent evidence**   
In 2016 Lazurit patented a generally similar submarine concept ([Here (in Russian)](http://www.freepatent.ru/patents/2508226))  
![Unbuilt Russian rescue submarine to replace INDIA Class - Covert Shores](/images/Lazurit_Patent.jpg)   
Key:  

1. Combat submarine - clearly a SIERRA Class SSN2. Removable rescue unit3. Deep Sea Rescue Vehicles (DSRV) - clearly Project 18271 "Bester"4. Removable module unmanned underwater apparatus5. Removable modules communicate with the submarine body through coaming native-platform6. Additional coaming-platform7. Docking station8. Thruster to allow submarine to hover9. Anchor10. Submarine's own esape pod (rescue capsule)

11. temporary storage of compressed gas cylinders on torpedo racks12. Temporary additional accommodation for rescue crew and survivors

An earlier 2012 patent by Lazurit ([Here (in Russian)](http://www.freepatent.ru/patents/2525188))showed a similar concept:  
![Unbuilt Russian rescue submarine to replace INDIA Class - Covert Shores](/images/Lazurit_Patent_2.jpg)   

And another ([Here (in Russian)](http://www.freepatent.ru/patents/2523055)):  
![Unbuilt Russian rescue submarine to replace INDIA Class - Covert Shores](/images/Lazurit_Patent_3.jpg)   

And for a diesel-electric submarine ([Here (in Russian)](http://www.freepatent.ru/patents/2510356)):

**Project 18271 "Bester" submersible**   
The orange and white midget submarine is a Project 18271 "Bester" ("Бестер" пр.18271) recue submersible which can also be used for general purpose 'underwater engineering' such as working on seabed sonar arrays:
