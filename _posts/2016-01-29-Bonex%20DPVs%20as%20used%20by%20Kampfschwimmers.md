![Flag](/images/flag_germany.jpg) Bonex, a German diver propulsion vehicle (DPV) manufacturer, is known to supply several Special Forces units including the German Kampfschwimmers and Turkish SAT (*Sualtı Taarruz*, translating as 'Underwater Offence').

The Bonex HP DPV is in roughly the same class as the Italian Suex types, being a compact tow-behind scooter. The family crosses over from civilian to military market with a tougher finish and navigation add-ons for nighttime and poor visibility diving.

The type has a 3.5mm carbon fiber tube with hard coated aluminum back end. The nosecone is Delrin and the propeller nozzle is also aluminum.

 **Bonex HP Shuttle DPD**   

Bonex offers a small platform which allows two HP DPVs to be attached side by side with the diver laying on the frame in the middle, protected from the oncoming water by a simple Perspex watershield. This equates to other DPDs (Diver Propulsion Devices, in this sense used to denote a larger DPV) such as the Stidd and Suex twin-DPV rigs.
