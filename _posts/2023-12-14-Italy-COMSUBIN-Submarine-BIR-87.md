# Previously Unreported Italian Special Forces BIR-87 SDV Seen For First Time

![Flag Italy](/images/flag_italy.jpg) Italy's elite naval special forces, COMSUBIN (aka Incursori / GOI), is extremely secretive. And their swimmer delivery vehicles (SDVs) and submarines are among their best kept secrets. Only now, after it has been retired, has the BIR-87 been displayed to the public.   

It has been a good year for special forces underwater transport watchers. In June 2023 the Incursori revealed the [AE-90 submarine](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2023-06-02-Italy-COMSUBIN-Submarine %}). Now, on December 12, the **BIR-87** has been revealed.

Italy has a rich and proud history of special forces underwater craft. The BIR-87 was, as the designation shows, introduced in the late 1980s. The design lineage, built by Cabi Cattaneo, goes back [to the BIR-58](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2020-04-17-Italy-COMSUBIN-SDVs %}) and before. It is a formal of submersible boat with a hull form designed for long transits on the surface. For surface propulsion it uses a diesel motor which has a snorkel for semi-submerged running. The crew, possibly six, sit inline behind an instrument-packed water shield. A forward facing sonar is mounted on the water shield. Possibly a retractable navigation mast too.   

The craft can likely be carried in the cradle on Italy's submarines. For this is must be able to be carried deep, not typically a requirement for submersible boats. Length is about 7.5 meters.

This 'new' vehicle has likely been out of service over 10 years, what has replaced it is open to speculation.
