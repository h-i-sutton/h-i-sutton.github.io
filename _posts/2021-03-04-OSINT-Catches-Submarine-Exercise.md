#OSINT Crosshairs: Satellite Catches Submarine Photo OpDuring NATO's Dynamic Manta exercise in the Mediterranean last month a German Navy P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft conducted an anti-submarine exercise with an Italian Navy Type-212A Todaro Class submarine. The photographs and video of the submerged submarine, taken from the Orion, are incredible. But the *Marineflieger* were not the only ones taking images of the submarine.   

In a rare moment of a satellite overpass lining up with a military photo op, a commercial satellite appears to have captured the moment.

Eagle-eyed OSINT analysist [@OSINT_1 (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/OSINT_1) found the event in Sentinel-2 imagery.

Aircraft show as three blobs, one red, one green and one blue, because the satellite image is actually a composite. The satellite takes a sequence of three images in different color spectrums. So the satellite is in a slightly different position for each image. But with advanced 3d calculations (it's rocket science), they are combined into a single image. For non-moving objects on the land surface is not a problem. But fast moving objects in the sky the overlays are naturally misaligned so we see the three blobs.

We cannot be 100% confident that the satellite image is the exact same overpass, but it is strongly indicative of an aircraft exercising with a submarine. And that is very rare in itself.
