![Flag](/images/flag_USA.jpg) As impressive as some of the current and emerging SDV designs are, one stands out ahead of the crowd. The Proteus is designed and built by The Columbia Group (now part of Huntington Ingralls) who are known for the US Navy SEAL's current SDV (the Mk.8 Mod-1 Gator Class) and was (I assume) a contender for the next generation SEALs SDV. That contract went to another bidder but the Proteus remains an impressive beast,unrivalled in several key respects and equal to any in terms of pedigree. So what's so special about it?![proteus SDV](/images/Proteus_DMUV1.jpg)

The Proteus a **Dual Mode Underwater Vehicle** (DMUV) which means that it can operate either as a regular SDV (SEAL Delivery Vehicle) with a pilot and navigator, or as a Large Displacement Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (LDUUV). In fact it can operate in both modes in the same mission, offering unparalleled operational flexibility. The combination of large internal volume, advanced navigation and high reliability also means that it can be used as an underwater truck, covertly delivering packages (including passengers, sensors, munitions or stores) to teams in the field or high-risk locations. As well as the SDV roles the Proteus is also proposed for various Mine Countermeasures uses. It is this autonomous capability is what sets it apart from the rest, at least for the time being.

Outwardly the design is based on the Mk.8 SDV but but varies in almost every respect. The overall form is more cylindrical with a rounded hydrodynamic bow and a tapered stern with low-drag X-form tail surfaces. Like other SDVs there are no windows but the craft uses a 300kHz multi-beam Obstacle Avoidance Sonar (OAS) in the nose, GPS and four cameras for situational awareness. Manoeuvrability is aided by four thrusters, two mounded horizontally and two vertically. although there are two sets of personnel hatches arranged forward and aft like on the Mk.8, the on-board air supply (10,400 litres) and ballast tanks are arranged in a ring around the outside of the hull so that the crew can move from front to back inside the sub - in the older Mk.8 you couldn't do that, the two cockpits were completely separate. A combination of an RDI Doppler and a Fiber Optic Gyro (FOG)-based Photonic Inertial Navigation System (PHINS), is used for submerged navigation.
