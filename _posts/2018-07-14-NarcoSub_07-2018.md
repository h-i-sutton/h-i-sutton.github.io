**~30th March 2018, Colombia, Pacific coast**

**~April 2018**, Mexico, Eastern Pacific  

Mexican authorities detected a semi-submersible 275 nm west of the Manzanillo, Mexico. The Low Profile Vessel was in the process of transferring drugs to other boats. The crew fled in one of the other vessels that were going to receive the cocaine shipment. 1,731 kilos of cocaine were recovered. No photos.

**24th May 2018, Eastern Pacific**  

Crew of US Coast Guard Cutter Campbell intercepted a Low Profile Boat (LPV) in Eastern Pacific. Few details but design is typical of new rear-cabin types with outboard motors. USCG reported that the crew of the cutter recovered 12,000 lb (6 tons / 5.4 tonnes) of cocaine in six incidents.

**~13th July 2018, Eastern Pacific**  

Guatemalan anti-narcotics police intercepted a Low Profile Vessel (LPV) 190 nm off the Guatemalan coast in the Eastern Pacific. The vessel appears to be a Very Slender Vessel (VSV) although the design differs in detail from other VSV narco-subs, so possibly a different builder. It had 823 kilos of cocaine aboard. Only three crew, all Colombians, were detained; this is one short of the usual four-man crew.
