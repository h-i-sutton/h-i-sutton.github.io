Slightly ahead of the times, it had a flat deck to lay on, large watershield at the front and fold-out steerable thrusters at the back -a layout since been adopted by a growing number of DPVs. If it wasn’t for the robust but increasingly dated 24V DC rechargeable lead-acid battery technology you might be forgiven for thinking that the SeaShadow is a brand new design. –today the Li-Ion is the norm.

The design was sophisticated from the outset and has since been integrated with side-scan sonar, GPS and other advanced systems.
