# Guide To Ukrainian Interceptor Drones

![Flag Ukraine](/images/flag_ukraine.jpg) Ukraine is deploying a growing arsenal of purpose-built interceptor drones designed to counter enemy reconnaissance and strike drones. Among the most pressing threats are Russia’s Shahed/Geran and Gerbera systems. The interceptor drones continue to evolve, ranging from modified high-performance quadcopters to streamlined, projectile-like designs, and even a handful of fixed-wing types.  

In many ways, the rapid progression of drone technology mirrors the early evolution of military aviation during the First World War. What began as simple airborne scouts has quickly diversified into strike, bomber, and now fighter-style roles. While current interceptors, typically reaching speeds of around 300 km/h (with a few likely greatly exceeding this), cannot replace missiles when engaging high-performance aircraft, they are extremely well-suited for defeating battlefield drones and long-range strike drones such as the Shahed/Geran family. Crucially, they offer a far more cost-effective option: easier to produce, cheaper to field, and, at their most advanced, potentially capable of challenging jet-powered drones and even cruise missiles.  

This guide outlines the principal types and emerging trends in this fast-moving domain. It is not exhaustive and focuses only on systems that have been publicly disclosed.  

## Wild Hornets Sting-II

One of the better known types, the Sting is a small quadcopter designed to engage Russian Shahed/Geran and Gerbera strike drones. It was first revealed publicly in Autumn 2024, and has reportedly engaged hundreds of targets. It has an advertised top speed of 315 km/h. The design has gone through several iterations, with the main known version being the refined Sting-II.

## Tenebris Bagnet

An early mover introduced in early 2024, the Bagnet interceptor is designed to target Russian Geran (Shahed drones) flying at up to 250 km/h. The Bagnet itself cruises at 140 km/h, has a maximum speed of 250 km/h and an endurance of 20 minutes. It has an effective range of 15 km and carries a 1kg warhead. It employs completely autonomous interception once launched, leveraging the onboard electro-optical sensor in the nose and computer vision (AI). The French supplied **Alta Ares X-Wing** interceptor appears to be a variant of the Bagnet.

## Skyfall P1-Sun

High performance interceptor known to be used by ‘Dark Node’ unit. Russian estimates suggest a maximum speed of over 400 km/h and cruising speed of 300 km/h. Several variations of tail fins have been observed, likely reflecting continuous refinement.

## Octopus-100

The Octopus-100 interceptor is being jointly built by Ukraine and the United kingdom as part of the *Build with Ukraine* initiative announced on October 25, 2025. Few technical details are available but the design has a now-conventional quadcopter-bullet layout with notably large untampered wings and large stabilizers at the rear.

## ODIN Win_Hit

An early entrant to the purpose-built quadcopter interceptor game, the Win_Hit (often referred to simply as Odin after the manufacturer), is comparatively large. It features an autonomous final phase for the attack, likely involving computer vision AI. It has a cruising speed of 200–220 km/h, a maximum speed of 280-300 km/h, and a 7-10 minute endurance. It can be configured for daytime & dusk operations, or with different optics, for night operations.

## Vinnytsky Bdzholy VB140 Flamingo

The VB140 Flamingo interceptor drone is designed specifically to intercept Russian reconnaissance drones such as the Orlan-10 and Supercam. It uses FPV (first person view) control in its terminal phase. Being fixed wing it has a longer range than quadcopter interceptor drones, at 50 km. Maximum altitude is reported as 4,500 meters.

## TYTAN Technologies Tytan

A German developed interceptor, the Tyan is a fixed-wing design with two electric motors mounted in the leading edge of the wing. A camera in the nose steers the vehicle. The drone can reach 300 km/h (186 mph) and has an operational range of 20 km. TYTAN Technologies are known to be working on additional designs.

## Project Eagle Merops

A fixed wing drone with unusual shark-like fuselage, squashed X-rudders and large vertical endplate rudders on the main wings, the Surveyor/Merops is a major type deployed on the front lines. Reports indicate a top speed of 280 km/h. While its refined airframe likely contributes to its reported $15,000 unit price, this is still considerably cheaper than the Geran drones that it is designed to intercept.
