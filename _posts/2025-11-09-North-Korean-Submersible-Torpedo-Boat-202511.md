#Unreported North Korean Submersible Torpedo Boat May Be Uncrewed![Flag DPRK](/images/flag_nork.jpg) Hiding in the background of an official media image of the annual Defence Development exhibition in Pyongyang, North Korea, which opened on October 4, 2025, is a previously unreported vessel. The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) photo shows a model of a boat. Clear visual clues point to it being a submersible boat. Further, it appears to have torpedo tubes, and may be uncrewed.

The photo only provides a view from one angle, and the bow is obscured by two submarine launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). However the upper part of the cylindrical central compartment is clearly visible, as are large dive planes. Combined with North Korea’s history of submersible vessels, this makes it clear that it is a submersible design. The main sensor mast also appears submarine mast-like. Behind it appears to be a snorkel, possible with a simple inverted u-bend at the top.

There appear to be torpedo tubes inboard of the side of the hull, above the dive planes. The concept of a submersible torpedo boat appears increasingly relevant. When surfaced it can transit at very high speed, and then submerge to await a surface ship target. They are unlikely to have a sophisticated sonar or advanced combat systems, instead relying primarily on visual observation. The concept of operations is thus different from either regular fast attack craft or submarines. Individually they are less threatening than submarines yet offer their own versatility and advantages, primarily lower cost and training overheads.   

##Uncrewed?In today’s age it is tempting to also suggest that it may be uncrewed. The photos angle offers no view of the stern, so we cannot determine whether there is a crew cockpit there similar to other North Korean submersible boats. However, with the apparent submarine mast and no sign of a crew access hatch the uncrewed option seems sensible. If it is uncrewed it will increase challenges automating systems, and communicating with it. It would make it more threatening however, as it removes human endurance from the equation. (Ordinarily, being uncrewed also makes it more likely to be used in aggressive high-risk missions, but this may apply less to the Kim regime which appears to view its troops as expendable anyway).
