![Flag](/images/flag_russia.jpg) ![Flag](/images/flag_sweden.jpg) Photos of a recent military exercise in Crimea show the Swedish designed IC16MII Type Assault boat in service with the Russian Navy. The photos were taken on May 20th and emerged on Russian language military forums and discussions.  

The type is similar in capability to the more recent Russian CB-90 assault boat copies (BK-16 and Project 03160 ‘Raptor’) but features a cabin further aft.
