![Flag Russia](/images/flag_russia.jpg) ![Flag Ukraine](/images/flag_ukraine.jpg) This quiz covers warships, submarines and other naval vessels currently operating in the Black Sea as part of the war. Both Russian and Ukrainian types are shown.   

Although some may be less well known than others, I have resisted the temptation to include trick answers or jokes. All relevant to the current fighting.  

Following the success of my [military vehicle type quiz 1](Armored-Vehicle-Quiz.html), I’ve rediscovered the quiz functionality on my website. This quiz is mainly just for fun, but if you are a journalist or OSINT enthusiast, hopefully it is of real value too.

Good luck!
