##HighlightsTo keep things simple we normally only report anti-ship capabilities. But axillaries can be equally important especially in their patterns of movement. Two Project 304 Amur Class repair and depot ships have been moved to forward positions on either flank of the Crimean peninsular.   

PM-138 is believed to be on the West coast, in a lake with immediate access to the sea, and PM-56 on the East. These axillaries may be a key indicator of coming action., They perform urgent repairs on the high seas. Like field hospitals, they are not needed to be prepositioned during regular drills.
