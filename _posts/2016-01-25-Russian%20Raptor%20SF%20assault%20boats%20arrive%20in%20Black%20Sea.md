![Flag](/images/flag_russia.jpg) Only a couple of weeks since the very similar Kalashnikov BK-16 assault Boat was spotted at a Special Forces base in Sevastopol, the **Project 03160 ‘Raptor’** appears to be confirmed as also present. Two boats left Kronstadt in the Baltic and arrived in Novorossiysk on the black Sea in late December (reported 28th December). Novorossiysk is further east than Crimea but within easy range and puts these craft in-theatre for operations in the vicinity of Crimea.
