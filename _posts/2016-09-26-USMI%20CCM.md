 **A Special Forces boat USMI didn't advertise** *All information from public sources* [![](/images/Icon_Bluesky.jpg)](https://bsky.app/profile/covertshores.bsky.social)   

A new photo has emerged of a preiously unseen Combatant Craft Medium (CCM) special forces boat being tested by USSOCOM / NAVSOC.   

The craft is designed by USMI who also built the classic Mk.V SOC for Naval Special Warfare. It was built as prototype/demonstrator for the US Navy’s Combatant Craft Medium (CCM) requirement to replace the Mk.V. The it is similar to the Mk.V but smaller to allow deployment by C-17 aircraft. USMI lost out to Oregon Iron Works (now Vigor) but their CCM craft was interesting and highly capable
