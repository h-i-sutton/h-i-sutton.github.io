#Compact But Deadly: World Small Submarine Projects Compared![Flag Turkey](/images/flag_Turkey.jpg) ![Flag Italy](/images/flag_italy.jpg) ![Flag India](/images/flag_india.jpg) ![Flag Pakistan](/images/flag_pakistan.jpg) ![Flag Indonesia](/images/flag_indo.jpg) News that Turkish shipbuilder STM will start construction of the first STM-500 coastal submarine in 2022 brings small submarines back into focus. These diminutive vessels can pose a disproportionate threat to opposing forces in any conflict. The customer of the STM-500 is not public, speculation points to Pakistan or Ukraine.   

##STM 500![Flag Turkey](/images/flag_Turkey.jpg) Turkish [defense firm STM](https://www.stm.com.tr/en/our-solutions/naval-engineering) recently unveiled a 500 ton class submarine, the STM 500. The firm has been involved in the construction of Type-209 and Type-214 submarines for the Turkish Navy and has offered indigenous submarine designs before. The new design is significantly smaller however. There have been reports that construction of the submarine, for an undisclosed customer, will begin in 2022.

The design is firmly in the Coastal Submarine (SSC) size and tactical framing. It can carry torpedo reloads and is even offered with a short-endurance AIP (Air Independent Power). Although I would suspect that adding this may enlarge the overall submarine. The submarine's specifications incorporate some other cutting edge technologies such as lithium-ion batteries.   

**STM-500 Specifications**  
Length: 42 meters   
Beam: 4.2 meters   
Height: 8.5 meters   
Displacement: 485 tons surfaced, 540 tons submerged   
Speed: 18 knots maximum (likely submerged), 5 knots cruising  
Propulsion: 2 diesel generators, lithium-ion batteries, 1.5 MW electric motor   
Endurance: 3,200 nm on diesels, 75 nm on batteries (or 4,000 nm with diesel + AIP)   
Armament: 4 x 533mm (21") torpedo tubes with 4 reloads. Two of the tubes can be used for missiles.  
Crew: 18   
PAX: 6 special forces combat swimmers   
Other: Torpedo countermeasures

##M23, Qatars Mystery Italian X-Craft![Flag Italy](/images/flag_italy.jpg) Italian company M23 S.R.L. is building [two submarines for the Qatari Emiri Navy](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2024-09-13-M23-Submarine %}) (QEN). Although it has been alluded to in announcements relating to the larger Italian naval deal with Qatar, details have only slowly come out. At the time of writing the exact model of submarine has not been revealed. However, the hints have combined to paint a decent picture (see artist’s impression above).  

##SOV-400![Flag India](/images/flag_india.jpg) First reported by the Delhi Defence Review site on July 17 2021, [the SOV-400](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2021-07-20-Indian-SOV-400-Submarine-Design %}) is a new submarine design from Larsen & Toubro. As it's name implies it is around 400 tons placing it at the larger end of the 'midget submarine' spectrum. It appears optimized for Special Forces missions, carrying 10 SF operators.

**SOV-400 Specifications**   
Displacement: <490 tons surfaced, <550 tons submeged   
Length: 44 m   
Beam: 4.3 m   
Operating Depth: 100 m   
Speed: 10+ kt submerged, 6+ knors surfaced   
Operating depth: 1,000m (3,300ft   
Power plant: 2 x 400 kW generators driving 1 x 300 kW electric motor   
Crew: 10 + 10 PAX   
Endurance: 21 days   
Armament: 2 x 533mm (21") heavyweight torpedoes   
Payload: 2 x 4 PAX swimmer delivery vehicles (SDVs)   

##Pakistan Navy Indigenous X-Craft![Flag Pakistan](/images/flag_pakistan.jpg) This submarine is a small special forces type, measuring around 55 feet long by 7 to 8 feet across. The boat first appeared in 2016 but has [not been named or declared](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2020-07-14-Pakistani-SEALs-X-Craft-Midget-Submarine %}) by Pakistan. This may tie to a statement in the Pakistan Defence Production Division (MoDP) 2015-16 yearbook. It listed the "Indigenous design and construction of 01 Midget Submarine" as a target for 2016-2017.  
![X-Craft submarine Pakistan](/images/Pakistan-Midget-Submarines-Sat.jpg)  
It appears to have single-hull construction with a raised casing, at least along the forward section. The sail is very small, and possibly mounted further after than normal. Possibly this allows torpedo tubes to be carried under the forward casing.

##KSM-32, Indonesia's Little Project![Flag Indonesia](/images/flag_indo.jpg) The [KSM-32 (Kapal Selam Mini)](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2021-05-07-Indonesia-KSM-32-Submarine %}) is an indigenous midget submarine design from Indonesia. It has been developed by the BPPT (Badan Pengkajian dan Penerapan Teknologi / Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) as a stepping stone towards full-scale submarine construction. Design concepts began in 2016, then actual design from 2017 to 2019. It is an interesting design, but is unlikely to be built.
