#Narco Submarine Discovered On BeachThe Colombian Navy has sized another 'narco submarine' in operations against the “Clan del Golfo” group. The Organized Armed Group (OAG) is known to use improvised explosive devices to protect its shipments. The low profile vessel (LPV) was empty, but 2,346 kg of cocaine were seized in a related illegal warehouse.   

The LPV is an **LPV-OM-VSV-2-C** type which has a distinctive long canard running from the bow to almost the cabin. Like the vast majority of so-called 'narco submarines' this type does not fully submerge, instead running extremely low in the water. This makes it very difficult to see when in the water.

The operation took place in Punta Chori village, Nuquí, Chocó on the Pacific coast, with the LPV found in the estuary. Based on available photos the vessel was without outboard motors. Based on the rust marks, three motors had been fitted. This is an extra one compared to most previous encounters with this specific family of LPVs.   

So far this year, the Colombian Navy has seized 173 tons of cocaine in the Pacific, about 54% of the total seizures.
