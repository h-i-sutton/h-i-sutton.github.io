  Croatia (formerly part of Yugoslavia) has a track record of impressive midget submarines. The industry has struggled since independence with the Croatian Navy retiring its submarine capability. A new improved version of the R-3E design (better known as the Una Class) is now ready for construction however [Read More &gt;....](/New Croatian midget sub - Drakon 220.html "READ MORE")<br/><a href="/New Croatian midget sub - Drakon 220.html"><img src="/images/Yugo_Dragon_show1.jpg"/></a>

The Drakon (Dragon) 220 is a new midget submarine developed by Adria-Mar in Croatia. It is 50% longer and twice as heavy as the R-3E (aka Una class) which allows it to carry two torpedo tubes under the casing and accommodate a diesel-electric powerplant for a ten-fold increase in range. It retains the characteristic X-form control surfaces but has a new distinctive vertical bow to house the larger sonar and torpedo tubes, plus a fixed sail with integral diesel exhaust. Special forces optimisation remains per the R-3E.
