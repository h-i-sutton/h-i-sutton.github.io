#Ukraine's Marichka Underwater Drone (AUV)![Flag Ukraine](/images/flag_ukraine.jpg) The Marichka (МАРІЧКА) is a new large autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) developed by [AMMO Ukraine](https://ammo.army/). Among the many large AUV projects around the world, it is probably the first born directly from wartime needs. The project is seperate to the [Toloka family of AUVs](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2023-04-26-New-Ukraine-Underwater-Maritime-Drone %}) which are also being developed in Ukraine.   

The basic vehicle is 6 meters long and 1 meter in dimeter. Construction is metal with all or most of the hull being a pressure vessel. A keel appears to run along the bottom, and there are the expected towing loops.

*Video stills of the prototype being lowered into the water.*  

Ammo Ukraine have advertised the system as being for anti-ship, anti-bridge, intelligence gathering and transport. Range is reportedly 1,000km. Unit cost is stated as 16 million UAH, equivilent to 433k USD.

*At least one of the prototypes has an X-form rudder configuration. Note the nose cone on the floor at the front of the vehicle.*  

The project appears to be in the prototype phase and is looking for funding.
