#Chinese Navy (PLAN) Submarine Seen Configured To Carry Minisub![Flag China](/images/flag_China.jpg) The most advanced submarine in PLAN (Peoples Liberation Army Navy) service when she entered service in 1999, the first of class Type-039 Song class submarine 320 is now nearing the end of her useful life. She was the first Chinese submarine to feature true diesel-electric propulsion (where the diesels are only used to generate electricity), which is quieter, as well as raft mounted propulsion, anechoic coatings and Western (French) sonar, and anti-ship missiles.

Now several generations of submarine behind the latest Type-039C and Type-041 classes, it seems likely that the first in class Song is now assigned a specialized role. The submarine has been observed fitted with mountings for some sort of container or vehicle on her aft casing.   

We can be confident that it is 320 because it’s the only submarine with the distinctive stepped sail, a feature which was eliminated on subsequent boats to improve stealth.

The mounts are reminiscent of those used for carriage of a deep submergence rescue vehicle (DSRV). China already has DSRVs, so this is most likely a cradle for a deep diving submersible. Whether a DSRV or some other submersible, it is likely for seabed warfare or special operations missions.   

Curiously the raised mountings are not centered on the escape trunk, which would be expected for typical DSRV arrangements. They are however above it, suggesting that whatever is carried there needs direct access to the submarine. Possibly they are centered, but with the forward mountings flush with the deck which rises torwards the sail.  

Compared to later submarines this boat is much less stealthy and poses less of a threat to enemy submarines and warships. However, in common with Cold War practices in America and Britain, being near the end of life makes her more suitable for novel conversions.
