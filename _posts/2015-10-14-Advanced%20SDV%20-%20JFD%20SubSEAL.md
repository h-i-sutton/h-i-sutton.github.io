![](/images/flag_UK.jpg) Dry Deck Shelters (DDS) operators are an elite club and only a handful of top-tier *Blue Water* Navies have this capability. Despite this the popular image of a **SEAL Delivery Vehicle** (SDV), made popular by the US Navy's SDV Mk.VIII, is a small midget sub which specifically operates from a DDS. Therefore there are relatively few types designed from the outset for be carried into war in a DDS. The SubSEAL produced by Britain's James Fisher Defense (JFD) is one of these SDVs.

In design terms the SubSEAL follows the successful SDV Mk.VIII mold in most respects. Aside from some more modern fittings, the biggest departure is the steerable slow-turning main propulsor at the rear which eliminates the need for rear control surfaces:
