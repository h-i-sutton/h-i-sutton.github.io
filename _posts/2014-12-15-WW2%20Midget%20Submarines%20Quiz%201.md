Think you know your Seehund from your X-Craft? This quiz tests your knowledge of WW2 'sneak craft' including midget submarines, human torpedoes, commando canoes and explosive motorboats. There are no trick questions but some types look alike so take care picking your answers!

Difficulty varies and I threw in one which is super-difficult, so if you get a high score then you must really know your stuff! Five or more on the first go is a very decent score!

(If you like challenging yourself then try [assault rifle quiz 1](assault-rifle-quiz-1.html) and [assault rifle quiz 2](assault-rifle-quiz-2.html)!)

This quiz needs Javacsript.
