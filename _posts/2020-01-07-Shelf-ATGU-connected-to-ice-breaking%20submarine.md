**New OSINT on Russian 'Shelf' autonomous underwater reactor (ATGU)**   
![Flag](/images/flag_russia.jpg) Sometimes a connection between two systems is hiding in plain sight. In this case, the information was right here on Covert Shores! Thank you to Andre G who alerted me to this.   

St. Petersberg based design bureau Malachite, famous for designing many Russian submarines including the [ALFA](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2018-05-01-Alfa_Class_Submarine %}), AKULA and now [Laika](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2019-12-30-Husky_SSN %}), have left an interesting hint in one of their patent applications.   

The reactor section on the "[Submarine for servicing underwater mining complexes on the Arctic shelf and other underwater operations](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2019-01-14-Malachite_arctic_submarine %})" is identical to the ['Shelf' Automated ATGU](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2016-09-20-Analysis%20-Russia%20seeks%20submarine%20advantage%20in%20Arctic %}) (Атомная турбогенераторная установка: Nuclear Turbine Generator).

Both projects are quasi-civilian, and relate to hydrocarbon exploitation of the arctic ocean. In particular, under the ice cap. These platforms have a clear dual-use potential in naval operations, particularly sensor networks and intelligence. The submarine is intended for the maintenance and repair of underwater mining complexes on the Arctic shelf. The ATGU is a general purpose nuclear power installation intended for on-land (in arctic) and undersea applications. The Malachite website provides a power output of 4 Megawatts in the submarine platform. It is likely to be less for the Shelf application.
