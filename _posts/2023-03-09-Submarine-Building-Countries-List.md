# Countries That Can Design And Build Submarines Today

There are more countries building submarines today than there has ever been.   

Submarines are apex predators. Even the most basic or vintage types can be deadly to the enemy if operated competently. Fittingly, the best submarines are among the most expensive naval vessels in existence. At the same time the bottom-end designs represent incredible value for money for navies with only modest means.   

They are, by definition, extreme engineering. Even the most basic boat requires knowledge, skills and tools which set the entry bar pretty high. But their usefulness in modern warfare has driven many countries to enter the game. The list may be longer than you realized.   

This is a list of countries which can **design** and **build** a full-sized submarine(*see definition below*) today.   

## Building Nuclear Submarines

![FlagChina](/images/flag_China.jpg) China   

![Flag United Kingdom](/images/flag_UK.jpg) United Kingdom   

![Flag France](/images/flag_france.jpg) France   

![Flag Russia](/images/flag_russia.jpg) Russia   

![Flag India](/images/flag_india.jpg) India. First indigenous ballistic missile submarine (SSBN), INS Arihant, commissioned in 2016.

*Intelligence-based sketch of Wuchang Shipyard, China. China has the largest submarine building capacity of any country with 3 major shipyards involved, building both nuclear and non-nuclear types.*  

*The new construction halls (A) are at the center of the site. Thailand's new submarine is likely to have been built in the hall nearest the river (B). The submarines are rolled out of the sheds on rails (C) and launched sideways into the river (D). They are moored alongside to be fitted out (E). Expansive new halls are still being built in several areas of the site (F). Civilian ship building largely takes place in the open (G).*  

## Building Non-Nuclear Submarines

![Flag Germany](/images/flag_germany.jpg) Germany. Major exporter of submarines and submarine-building technology.   

![Flag Sweden](/images/flag_sweden.jpg) Sweden. Currently building A-26 class.   

![Flag Japan](/images/flag_japan.jpg) Japan. First country to use Lithium based batteries to power a full-sized submarine.   

![Flag Italy](/images/flag_italy.jpg) Italy. Builds Type-212A which is a joint German project. But retains knowledge to fully design own submarines.   

![Flag North Korea](/images/flag_nork.jpg) North Korea. The Gorae class is an indigenous design.   

![Flag South Korea](/images/flag_RoK.jpg) South Korea. Progressed from building German designs to its own. Also exports submarines.   

![Flag Spain](/images/flag_spain.jpg) Spain. Currently building S-80P submarines.   

![Flag Iran](/images/flag_iran.jpg) Iran. Indiginous Fateh class submarine is at the low-end of the spectrum but qualifies as a legitimate 'full-sized' submarine.   

## Emerging: Projects Underway

![Flag Taiwan](/images/flag_taiwan.jpg) Taiwan. First submarine design, the IDS, under construction. Some external help/influence   

![Flag Brazil](/images/flag_brazil.jpg) Brazil. Building Álvaro Alberto class nuclear submarine.   

![Flag Turkey](/images/flag_turkey1.jpg) Turkey. Having built German designs, now starting to offer indigenous types. First likely to be the MILDEN class.

*Iran's Fateh Class is a relatively basic design, and in many respects defines the minimum viable product for a 'full sized' submarine. Credit where credit is due.*  

## Have Some Required Elements But No Projects

![Flag Australia](/images/flag_aus.jpg) Australia. Has build Swedish-designed Collins class. However opting for imported nuclear submarine designs (AUKUS).   

![Flag Indonesia](/images/flag_indo.jpg) Indonesia. Builds German designed submarines (via South Korea). Has flirted with indigenous designs but no clear plans.   

![Flag Netherlands](/images/flag_netherlands.jpg) Netherlands. Used to build submarines but design capability lost c2000. However lots of expertise in country.   

![Flag Pakistan](/images/flag_pakistan.jpg) Pakistan. Local construction of French and now Chinese boats. Has built an indigenous midget submarine.   

![Flag Norway](/images/flag_norway.jpg) Norway. Some infrastructure but focusing on German designs.

*Australia built 6 Collins class submarines starting the 1990s. The next class, the nuclear-powered AUKUS, will also not be a local design. Photo ASC*  

## Definition

For simplicity we will define a full-sized submarine as having the following *minimum* characteristics:< br>

A. Pressure hull diameter of about 4 meters or more, and length of around 50 meters. The intent here is that it requires a shipyard, it cannot be built in the industrial unit at the bottom of your street.   

B. Diving depth of 100 meters or more. So proper materisals and design required.   

C. Ability to stay submerged for several days with multiple submerging and surfacing evolutions. This also means crew facilities, with people working watches (shifts)   

D. Crew of 10 or more, likely much more. Therefore requiring accommodation, mess, galley and other facilities often skipped on smaller submarines.   

E. More than one power source (I.e. batteries plus diesel), with a snorkel and means to recharge batteries at sea.   

F. Torpedo tubes and torpedo room with ability to at least remove a torpedo from the tube into the room. Lots of smaller subs skip this.
