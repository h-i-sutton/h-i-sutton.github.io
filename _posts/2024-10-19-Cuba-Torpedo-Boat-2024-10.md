#Clearer Images Of Cuba's Latest Home-Built Torpedo Boat![Flag Cuba](/images/flag_cuba.jpg) Cuba's beleaguered navy, the Las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Cuba (FAR), continues to field locally produced vessels. The latest type of note, first observed in 2021, is a torpedo boat. Recent photos provide new details of this unique craft.

Analysis of available imagery, including satellite images, indicates that it is around 20 meters long and equipped with legacy Soviet 21" (533mm) heavyweight torpedoes. Although the boat has a passing resemblance to North Korean / Iranian types, it appears completely indigenous. Whether the hull is a conversion or new-build is less clear however.

##Cuba's Torpedo NavyThis vessel is likely the only one of its type in service with the Cuban Navy. However Cuba has equipped smaller 'party raft' vessels with a single torpedo, either in a tube on the deck, or slung between the pontoons.
