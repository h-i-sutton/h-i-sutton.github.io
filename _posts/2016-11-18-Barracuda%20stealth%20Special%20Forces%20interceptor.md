![Flag](/images/flag_ireland.jpg) Specialist boat builder [Safe Haven Marine](http://www.safehavenmarine.com/) have added the stealthy XSV-17 to their Barracuda series of Special Forces craft. The new design features a high speed surfacing planing hull with a wave-piercing bow which allows incredibly high speeds (60kt) while maintaning the impressive sea-keeping of the Barracuda series. The design joins the SV-11 and SV-13 models which have already been prototyped and tested by elite units.

Safe Haven Marine are known for the formidable sea-keeping of their small working boats, being at home in the notoriously rough Irish Sea and Bay of Biscay.

![](/images/Safehaven_SV11_vert.jpg)The first Special Forces interceptor from Save Haven Marine was the SV-11 which, as the name implies, was 11m (36ft) long. The boat differs significantly from its competitors in the use of a deep-v semi-displacement / planing hull which is better suited to rough weather than a regular fully planing hull. The compromise is on speed which is limited to 40kt. It also retained the think rubber fender of Save Haven’s pilot and rescue boats, making it ideal for vessel boarding operations.   

The watertight cabin and three internal sections allows the vessel to be completely rolled over and remain dry inside. If it does capsize in heavy seas, the hull is self-righting.   

The prototype was fitted with propellers for rough sea performance, which allowed 35kt top speed. For inshore and riverine operations waterjets would be preferred and these would allow 40kt top speed.

 **Barracuda SV-13**    

![safehaven Marine Engineering Barracuda SV-11 SV-13 XSV-17 Interceptors](/images/Safehaven_SV13_2.jpg)   

The -13 is slightly larger than the SV-11 with a larger working deck at the stern and other iterative improvements. Like the earlier model the main machine gun mount is concealed under a hatch in the forward deck when not in use.   

 **Specifications**   

Displacement: 14,500kg (12,500kg lightships)   

Lengh: 13.7m  

Beam: 4m  

Draft: 1.15m   

Range: 200nm+   

Speed: 40kt max with waterjets, 35kt with props   

Capacity: 6 crew plus 10 men (without weapons mount fitted)  

Propulsion: 2 x 650hp deisel-electrics driving MJP Ultra Jet 340 waterjets, or props  

Armament: 1 x remotely operated, stabilized 12.7mm (.50Cal) heavy machine gun pn retractable mount, 4 x 7.62mm MG on pedestal mounts

 **Barracuda XSV-17**

Although the family resemblance is clear, the new XSV-17 is a significant departure from the earlier -11 and -13 models. The longer wave-piercing bow offsets a faster full-planing hull. The retractable machinegun mount is retained, and a second firing position with near 360degrees coverage is added to the cabin roof, but the external crewed positions on the working deck are sacrificed for stealth.
