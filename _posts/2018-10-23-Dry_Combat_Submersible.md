[MSUBS](http://www.msubs.com/manned-submersibles/) has designed a range of DCS:  

● **S301 / S301i** 8-person all-electric DCS proof-of-concept operated by USSOCOM as **UOES1**  
● **S351 Nemisis** 10-person all-electric DCS demonstrator operated by USSOCOM as **UOES2**  
● **DCS** 10-person all-electric DCS production model for USSOCOM   
● **S361** 10-person all-electric DCS export model   
● **S302** 8-person all-electric DCS for export   
● **S303** compact 8-person all-electric DCS small enough to fit within a dry deck shelter (DDS)  
● **S401** large 18-person DCS with Fuel cell AIP or diesel-electric options  

  
  
**S351 Nemisis** & **DCS**  
In July 2016 USSOCOM announced a $166m multi-year contract for Lockheed Martin to design, build, test and maintain a production model of the DCS. Lockheed are partnered with The Submergence Group LLC and their British design shop/factory [MSUBS](http://www.msubs.com/manned-submersibles/) to deliver a total of three craft, although only the first is currently confirmed.   
![UOES2 Dry Combat Submersible](/images/UOES2_1.jpg)  
The USSOCOM requirement was specified as a **Surface Launched** submersible. The current model is therefore not designed to be carried by a submarine in the way that existing SEAL Delivery Vehicles (SDVs) are. This means that the main launch platform is likely to be MV Ocean Trader (ex-Cragside), a Special Warfare Support vessel operated by US Military Sealift Command.

Starting in 2020, USSOCOM will begin notional studies of **Submarine Integration**, most likely for the Virginia Class SSN. The target production date of 2026, by which time all three of the original surface-launch-only boats should be in service:

The S351 is promoted in the United States by [Lockheed Martin](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/manned-combat-submersible.html). It went through extensive trials with USSOCOM under the program designation **UOES2** (User Operational Evaluation System). It beat the smaller but similarly impressive Italian designed [UOES3](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2015-06-22-SEALs%20+%20USSOCOM%20next%20generation%20sub%20UOES3 %}) which was designed to fit inside a Dry Deck Shelter (DDS) on a submarine, but sacrificed carry capacity. The UOES3 is now on display at the [The National Navy SEAL Museum](https://www.navysealmuseum.org/):

**S361**   
An export orientated design very similar to the USSOCOM DCS. MSUBS offers this craft for £25m.   
![UOES2 Dry Combat Submersible](/images/DCS_S361.jpg)  

**S361 Specifications**   
Length: 12m   
Beam: 2.5m   
Height: 3.2m  
Weight: 30 tonnes  
Depth rating: tbc  
Maximum lock-out depth: tbc  
Endurance: tbc   
Range: tbc  
Speed: tbc   

  
  
**S302**   
This mid-sized variant is intended for export. The S302 is slightly larger than the S301i which allows for a cleaner and more conventional layout with X-form control surfaces and a single propeller at the rear. The main diver lock-out hatch is moved amidships from the unusual the stern placement on S301i, and the battery pods are incorporated into a streamlined hull. It is no longer intended for carriage in a Dry Deck Shelter (DDS).  
![Dry Combat Submersible (DCS) - Covert Shores](/images/LM_DCS.png)  

**S302 Specifications**   
Length: 9.36m (31ft) *(vs 7.25m / 24ft fr S301i)*   
Beam: 2.34m (7.7ft)  
Height: 2.34m (7.7ft)  
Weight: 14,000 kg (31,000lb) loaded  
Depth rating: 100m (328ft)  
Maximum lock-out depth: 30m (98ft)  
Endurance: 24hrs +   
Range: 60nm @ 5kt  
Speed: At least 8kt

**S303** DDS compatible DCS  
The eight-person S303 has improved performance over the S301 while also being small enough to be transportable submersible in submarine dry shelters (including converted vertical launch tubes) or, on the deck of small diesel-electric submarines. It can also be deployed by surface ships with cranes. The S303 is available for approximately £20m.   
![Dry Combat Submersible (DCS) - Covert Shores](/images/DCS_S303_3.jpg)  

**S303 Specifications**   
Length: 7m   
Beam: 2m   
Height: TBC  
Weight: 14 tonnes  
Depth rating: 300m  
Maximum lock-out depth: tbc  
Endurance: ~24 hours mission; 96 hours reserve   
Range: tbc  
Speed: tbc   

#### 

  
  
**S401**   
The largest design in the series, the S401 approaches the size of the ill-fated ASDS (Advanced SEAL Delivery System) which was a precursor to the DCS program. It has the same width and height as the S361 but has an extra seating compartment. It can carry sixteen combat swimmers and has multiple propulsion options from Li-ion all-electric to Fuel cell AIP (Air Independent Power) or Diesel-Electric.

Weight: 40 tonnes  
Depth rating: tbc

Endurance: tbc   
Range: tbc  
Speed: tbc

**S301 / S301i**   
Originally designed by MSUBs/The Submergence Group, the S301i was on lease to USSOCOM by Lockheed Martin from 2013-15. The S301i started life after the cancellation of the Advanced SEAL Delivery System (ASDS) as a demonstrator to validate the credibility of a dry combat submersible small enough to fit inside the dry deck shelter (DDS) on a submarine. No actual DDS operations were conducted but the demonstration was considered a success and follow-on UOES-2 ten-man and UOES-3 six-man DCS were ordered.   
![Lockheed S301i Dry Combat Submersible](/images/S301i.jpg)  
*The S301 was christened 'Marie' by Submergence Group. The conning tower would be removed for DDS operations.*
