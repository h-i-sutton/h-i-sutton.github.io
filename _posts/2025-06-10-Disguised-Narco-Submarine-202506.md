# 2 Rare Disguised Narco Submarines Discovered On Trans-Atlantic Route

Brasilian Navy and Federal Police seized a low-profile 'narco submarine' used to transport cocaine to Europe on May 31 2025. The nearly-complete vessel, which was discovered on Marajó Island, was unusual in its appearance. It was disguised as a local fishing vessel with a fake deckhouse which would be removed once out to sea. It is categorized as a LPV-IM-1-qD in the Covert Shores taxonomy.

The suspicious vessel was initially identified by a Brazilian Air Force (Força Aérea Brasileira - FAB) R-99 aircraft, with the help of Brasil's own satellites, at a makeshift jetty in the municipality of Chaves, on the Marajó Archipelago, Pará. The raid was then made by the Brazilian Navy and Federal Police.

The specific design features directly connect this to another 'narco submarine' captured by Portugal off the Azores in March 25 2025. There are several distinctive design choices which show that they have the same master builder. Given the latest vessel's location on the Atlantic coast, and this earlier interdiction, it is clear that it was intended to sail across the Atlantic.

The vessels are around 18 meters long and weigh approximately 25 tonnes. Cargo capacity is around 7 tonnes of cocaine. The one interdicted off the Azores was carrying 6.5 tonnes.   

A similarly disguised vessel was also discovered in Ecuador on December 15 2015, although there is no clear design lineage connection.
