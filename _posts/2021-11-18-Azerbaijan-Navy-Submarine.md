#Improbable Navy Submarine Seen In Caspian SeaA video has surfaced [showing an unusual submarine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sKRChIFgPM) being used by the Azerbaijani State Border Service.The two submersibles, together with two Iguana-Pro amphibious boats, are shown operating from the working deck of a Multi-Purpose Offshore Vessel. The ship appears to be TURKAN, anOffshore Tug/Supply Ship (IMO: 9416460, MMSI: 423477100) registered in Azerbaijan.   

The story was run [by Milli.az](https://news.milli.az/politics/980447.html) (in Azerbaijani) in September and has recently been picked up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AbraxasSpa/status/1460999398624837641).

Azerbaijan has extensive offshore infrastructure including platforms. The use of generally similar submersibles in oil and gas exploration is not unheard of. However their application for border guards or navies is less clear. They are not equipped with weapons, cannot transport divers and have limited sensor or observation capabilities. And they are optimized for deep up-down trips more than long range missions. Maximum speed is only about 3 knots.

This type of submarine is popular among mega yacht owners for recreational purposes. It is possible (but unconfirmed) that these two submersibles entered the country for this purpose. Or for tourism. Previously Azeri businessmen have gifted similar submarines to the government:
