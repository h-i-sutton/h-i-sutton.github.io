##Surface Groups**Marshal Ustinov** group. 1 x SLAVA Class Cruiser, 1 x UDALOY-I Class Destroyer and 1 x Admiral Gorshkov class frigate. continues to track east at a slow 10 knots. We believe that her most likely destination is Tartus where she may resupply.   

**Varyag group**. 1 x SLAVA Class Cruiser, 1 x UDALOY-I Class Destroyer . Possibly other warships. Active in Eastern Mediterranean  

**Moskva**. 1 x SLAVA Class Cruiser, unreported escorts. has been involved in drills in the Black Sea. We still have her as likely to transit to the mediterranean in the coming days. She doesn't have any land-attack cruise missiles so is not that valuable in the Black Sea except for air defense.  

Background  **[VIDEO BRIEF on YOUTUBE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBuTBMfK7pc)**  

##SubmarinesKILO Class submarine **Rostov-na-Donu** which we previously reported as en-route to the Black Sea passed the Bosporus today and is now in the black Sea. This leaves two in the Mediterranean and four (active) in Black Sea. Because they can carry a small number (~4) Kalibr land-attack cruise missiles they may play a role in the opening throws on any attack on Ukraine.   

2 x KILO Class submarines, **Krasnodar** and **Novorossiysk**, on patrol in Eastern / Central Med. Exact position not known. To be confirmed.  
3 x KILO submarines believed to be in Sevastopol and /or now in Novorossiysk.
