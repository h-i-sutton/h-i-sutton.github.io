#Iranian Fateh Class Submarine Proposed With AIP![Flag Iran](/images/flag_iran.jpg) Iran has displayed a version of their first indigenous full-size submarine, the Fateh Class, with AIP (Air Independent Power). According to information [gathered by Naval News](https://www.navalnews.com/event-news/dimdex-2024/2024/03/iran-unveils-aip-version-of-fateh-class-submarine-at-dimdex-2024/), the Iranians plan to install the AIP on the first Fateh. If it is deemed successful, it could be installed on subsequent boats.   

The AIP is likely a Stirling engine type, or less likely, a fuel cell type. The model appears to show three Stirling generators in containers. The AIP is housed in a hull insert behind the sail and ahead of the main propulsion spaces approximately 5 meters long. The liquid oxygen (LOX) is contained in a number of smaller flasks in a false keel running along the bottom of the hull.

Like several models used by Iran at shows it is noticeably crude and shouldn’t be relied on for details beyond the AIP section gaffer taped to the middle.  

AIP will not make the submarine top-tier, it is still a small and relatively basic boat. But it would make it comparatively more stealthy and therefore increase the threat it poses. There is some merit in small coastal submarines being fitted with AIP.
