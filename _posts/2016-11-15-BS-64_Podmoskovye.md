[![](/images/Icon_Bluesky.jpg)](https://bsky.app/profile/covertshores.bsky.social)**BS-64 Podmoskovye - New Russian Special Mission spy-sub**   

![Flag](/images/flag_russia.jpg) BS-64 *Подмосковье* (**Podmoskovye** = ‘Moscow Oblast’) is a Project 09787 **DELTA-IV STRETCH** ballistic missile submarine which has been converted into a host submarine for nuclear powered midget-subs. She was relaunched on October 22nd and is expected to join 29th Separate Brigade of submarines of the Northern Fleet at their secretive base at Olenya Guba (Deer Bay) on the Murmansk Oblast. The 29th Separate Brigade operate a range of Special Mission submarines (read ‘Spy submarines’) for GUGI (Main Directorate Deep Sea Research). Podmoskovye will be used as a Host Submarine (‘mother submarine’) for some of the midget submarines based there, most likely including the elusive Project 10831 **LOSHARIK**.

It is likely that Podmoskovye will be involved in the laying of the ‘SHELF’ Russian arctic sensor network. See [Russia seeks submarine advantage in Arctic]({% post_url 2016-09-20-Analysis%20-Russia%20seeks%20submarine%20advantage%20in%20Arctic %}) (SHELF system, GUGI special mission subs)

 **Conversion to Special Mission Host Submarine**   
Work on BS-64 started at the Star shipyard in Severodvinsk on the White Sea in 1999 although she laid up unfinished for many years until 2012 when work resumed. The missile section, which originally held 16 x R-29RMU Sineva (SS-N-23A SKIFF) liquid-fueled missiles which each carry four independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs) was cut out and replaced by a very long hull insert of similar diameter. The insert is slightly longer, adding about 7m to the overall length (174m vs 167m). Despite the ample space provided by the double-hull configuration a raised deck is still required although the ‘hump back’ of the original missile section is removed.
