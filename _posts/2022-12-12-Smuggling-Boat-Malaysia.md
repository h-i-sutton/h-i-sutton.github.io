# Rare Smuggling Boat Captured In Malaysia

A large go-fast boat has been interdicted [by the Malaysian Coast Guard](https://twitter.com/GardaAramis/status/1600016121939517440). The vessel is generally similar to those used off China for smuggling cars and other goods. Yet while smuggling is not unknown in Southeast Asia, these types of boats are rare there. Or at least rarely reported.

The vessel is much larger than the go-fasts used to smuggle narcotics in Latin America. It has a central cargo deck and small covered cabin forward. The cabin is much further forward than you would expect for a powerboat, a compromise showing that the design is focused on the payload.

It is unclear what it was smuggling, but possibly cars.
