#Ukraine's SBU Reveals Mamai Maritime Drone (USV)![Flag Ukraine](/images/flag_ukraine.jpg) Ukraine's SBU (Security Service of Ukraine) has revealed another type of maritime drone. The Mamai type is combat proven. It was used in the attacks on the Ropucha Class landing ship Olenegorsky Gornyak and the tanker Sig. Both attacks, far away from Ukrainian controlled territory, inflicted significant damage.

It is named after Kozak Mamai (Cossack Mamai/Mamay), a Ukrainian folk hero and one of the standard characters in traditional Ukrainian 'Vertep' puppet theater. The design is much larger than the canoe-like USVs (uncrewed surface vessels) first seen in September 2022. And the Magura family of USVs used by GUR (The Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine). All the same its overall dimensions are still compact. The increased volume likely allows for a large fuel load, giving its demonstrated long range.

The design uses a planing hull which allows a reported top speed of 60 knots (110 kmph). One, sometimes two, satellite communications antenna are fitted, and there is an electro-optical camera-ball. The warhead is detonated by any of three impact sensors protruding at the bow. These have, on this particular model, proven reliable.

*Evidence that the Mamai was used in the August 3-4 attack on the Russian Navy Ropucha Class landing ship Olenegorsky Gornyak outside Novorossiysk. It was also used to attack the Russian Government tanker Sig on August 5 south of Kerch Bridge.*
