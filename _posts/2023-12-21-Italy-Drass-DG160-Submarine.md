#Italian Midget Submarine under Construction In Romania For Undisclosed Customer![Flag Italy](/images/flag_italy.jpg) The Italians have a reputation for building small submarines. Having invented the modern notion of naval special forces over 100 years ago, there is a natural affinity to sneak attacks. So it is no surprise that more than other submarine building nations, they develop smaller submarines optimized to special operations. Leonardo’s new S800 design is one higher-profile example, but there is another which is already under construction.

The [Drass DG-160](https://www.drass.tech/projects/drass-dg160/) is an interesting design. And in Italian arms sales tradition it is shrouded in mystery and speculation. Although we know of the project, and that it is being built deep inland in Romania, we do not know of the customer. The construction site, on a nondescript industrial estate in a Romanian town, is 375 miles (600 km) from the Black Sea.

The design lineage back to famous Cos.Mo.S company is clear. Drass' latest submarine bears a strong family resemblance to the unbuilt [Cos.Mo.S X-201 SWATS](https://covertshores.blogspot.com/2011/09/italian-small-submarines-updated.html) (shallow water attack submarine) concept but with a more conventional ‘+’ tail section based on the MG-120 design.
