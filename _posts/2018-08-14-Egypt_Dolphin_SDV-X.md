**Dolphin SDV-X**  
The Dolphin Class advanced Swimmer Delivery Vehicle (SDV-X) was developed in the 2000s by the Columbia Research Corporation. It was based on the **SDV Mk.VIII Mod-1 Gator Class** SDV still in service with the USN SEALs. 36 craft were reportedly supplied to Egypt, giving them among the best equipped special forces combat swimmer capabilities in the world.

**Diver Propulsion Vehicle**  
Although it is unconfirmed, the Diver Propulsion Vehicle appears to be a US made Farallon Mk.8:

**SeaFox Special Forces transport**  
The Seafox Special Forces boat was originally designed for the US Navy SEALs in the 1970s. Eight were subsequently supplied to Egypt in the 1980s. The crat was originally used to transport the Italian supplied Cos.Mo.S CE2F two-man chariot but these are likely long-since retired and it is not confirmed that it is large enough to tow the Dolphin SDV-X.

Although it is unconfirmed, Egypt appears to operate the LARR (Launch and Recovery Raft) developed by Columbia Research Corporation (ref. Patent 6840188):

LARR with Dolphin SDV-X, possibly during testing in US:

**Other**  
The display also included a regular Mk.37 21" (533mm) torpedo which Egypt carries on its upgraded Type-033 ROMEO Class submarines. The Mk.37 was the basis for the Stand-off Weapon Assembly (SWA) which the US Navy SAEL teams and UDT teams used on their Mk.IX SDVs. The larger Mk.8 SDV can also carry this size of payload. Although the Dolphin SDV-X can carry external stores, they are not reported to include torpedoes.
