#Fake Position Reported For Russian Navy Cruiser Ustinov![Flag Russia](/images/flag_russia.jpg) One of the Russian Navy's two remaining SLAVA Class cruisers, Marshal Ustinov, has appeared on AIS (automated identification system). The reported position is in the Norwegian Sea, near where some Russian warships have been operating. The AIS data is false however, Ustinov is nowhere near there.   

The AIS report is under the [MMSI: 273798095 and name "WARSHIPUSTINOV"](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:6962450/mmsi:273798095/imo:0/vessel:WARSHIPUSTINOV). This in itself is not suspicious. Some Russian Warships, including Ustinov, have been known to use multiple MMSIs. For Ustinov this includes:   

* MMSI: 273776875 "USTINOV"* MMSI: 122570899 "USTINOV"* MMSI: 273765767 "WARSHIP USTINOV"

However this latest track is suspicious in several ways. It appears to be a single position, and was posted on MarineTraffic via 'Self Reporting' instead of a terrestrial ground station. AIS can be manipulated at multiple points in the chain, but this does hint at a completely false report. And there are other indicators noted. The culprits and their motives can only be speculated at however.

Marshall Ustinov is the sister ship of Moskva, the Russian Navy Black Sea Fleet's flagship which was sunk on April 13-14. In the lead-up to the Ukraine invasion it was deployed from the Northern Fleet to the Mediterranean. This was part of a deterrence against NATO intervention. Blocked from sailing into the Black Sea, she stayed there until August 24 2022 when she had to return. She is now back at her base in the Russian Arctic.   

The false AIS may be related to the operations a Russian Navy frigate currently off Norway. The Norwegian armed forces are monitoring the Admiral Gorshkov as it sails southwards along the coast of Norway. She is [reportedly carrying Zircon](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-sends-off-frigate-armed-with-new-hypersonic-cruise-missile-2023-01-04/) hypersonic anti-ship missiles.
