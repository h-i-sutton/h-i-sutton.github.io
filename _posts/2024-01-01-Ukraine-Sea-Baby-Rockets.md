# Ukraine's SBU Reveals Rocket-Armed Sea Baby USV

![Flag Ukraine](/images/flag_ukraine.jpg) Ukraine's SBU (Security Service of Ukraine) has revealed has shown evidence of 'Sea Baby' USVs (uncrewed surface vessels) shooting rockets or missiles. The engagement took place in Sevastopol Bay. It is possibly related to December 30 reports from Russian sources of an engagement there.

The Sea Baby USVs were already known to carry some form of rocket or missile. Variations of two, four and six small rocket tubes have been seen. These are possibly RPV-16 thermobaric rockets which are unguided and have a range of around 1,000 meters. But could easily be replaced by other weapons.

These weapons could serve several purposes. As well as being a primary way to attack a target, they could be used to defend against surface threats. During an attack with a ram-charge, the rockets could be launched to distract or suppress defenses. This latter tactic was used on some Imperial Japanese explosive boats in World War Two.
