2019 is already looking set to be another bumper year of narcosub incidents, following the three-fold increase witnessed in 2018.This article is one of a series documenting and analyzing narco-sub incidents and trends. Ref. previous articles from:

**Possible new family of VSV nacrosub**  
![Narcosubs - Covert Shores](/images/Narco_201903_1.jpg)  
A Low Profile vessel (LPV) intercepted by the Colombian Navy in March may represent the first sighting of a new family of nacrosubs. The camouflaged vessel combines the once-standard layout of having the payload in the bow, cockpit amidships and single internally mounted engine in the stern with the recent trend to Very Slender Vessels. VSV-narcosubs started to be seen spring 2017 and have evolved into two distinct lineages, but all have featured aft-mounted cockpits and outboard motors. The boat is 20 meters long and just two meters wide giving a fineness ratio of 10:1. See below

**Narco Sub #1**  
At-sea intercept of camouflaged four-man mid-cockpit LPV with VSV features - possibly significant if it represents a new family of narcosubs. Crew consisted of two Mexicans, one Ecuadorian and one Colombian. Length 20 meters, width 2 meters, payload 1,535kg cocaine. Intelligence-led operation.  
![Narcosubs - Covert Shores](/images/Narco_201903_1Side.jpg)

Converted speedboat type narcosub with higher profile cockpit than most other examples (similar boat captured 30th March 2018). 17 meters length, 4 meters beam. Captured in jungle boatyard.  
![Narcosubs - Covert Shores](/images/Narco_201903_2.jpg)  

**Narco Sub #3**  
Rear-engined low profile vessel (LPV) of less common stretched-converted-speedboat family. 20 meters length, 4 meters beam. Simiilar to Feb 2017, 6th Sept 2018 and 22nd October 2018 vessels. Captured in jungle boatyard.

**Colombian forces intercept narcosub in Pacific**  
24th March 2019  
Colombian Air Force SR-560 aircraft (Cessna 560 Citation V) under the operational control of the Combat Air Command No.7 identified the low profile vessel (LPV) in Colombian Pacific region, with the interception being made by the Colombian Navy. This LPV neatly fits within an emerging sub-family of outboard-motor LPVs.

**Mexican Navy intercepts narcosub being unloaded**  
30th March 2019  
The traditional-layout Low Profile Vessel (LPV) with an inboard motor was intercepted by the forces from ZN-14 (14th Naval Zone) in the Pacific, off Puerto Chiapas. Two packages of cocaine (tbc) were left aboard as the crew and possibly others fled, leaving the narcosub and other small craft abandoned.

*One of the smaller vessels lays abandoned on the beach after the chase. This is clearly a boat which went to meet the narcosub as the LPV itself can only carry inflatable boats.*

*Previously missed:* **VSV narcosub on Costa Rican beach**  
27th July 2018  
A narcosub with 1.2 tons of cocaine was discovered on a beach on Punta Burica. It was reported to only have two 75-horsepower Yamaha outboards so possibly one was missing. And although reported as being 12 meters long, this family of VSV narcosubs are generally longer (~18 meters) and this example appears consistant.

6th September 2018  
Panamanian forces seized an empty VSV-1 family narcosub, reportedly a first for the country. It had a capacity of approximately 3 tons of cocaine. Despite similarities, it appears to be a separate boat from the above.

14th September 2018  
Colombian Navy personnel inspected a 25 meter VSV abandoned on Palo Secal beach, Bajo Baudó municipality, Chocó. The vessel was minus its outboard motors and appears to have been partially burnt. The craft was reportedly associated with the ELN, Colombia’s last Marxist guerrilla group which has been around for more 50 years.
