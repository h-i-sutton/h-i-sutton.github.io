#OSINT - 4 Russian Navy Improved-KILO Class Submarines In Tartus, Syria![](/images/flag_russia.jpg) There are currently 5 Russian Navy Pr.636.3 Improved KILO Class submarines [in the Mediterranean](https://twitter.com/KaptainLOMA/status/1439149448370794497). Analysis of Open sources confirms that four of them are in Tartus, Syria.   

September-17 imagery from a Sentinel-2 satellite shows the four boats. Submarines can be extremely different to see on low-resolution satellite imagery. However there is confidence in this ID. Two of the submarines are in the usual place, and two directly opposite. Several Russian warships and support ships are also present.
