The Colombian Navy has discovered its latest narco-sub hidden in the jungle along the Pacific Coast. Interestingly, this craft fits into the rare *Snorkel sub* category, and is closer to a real submarine than the typical *Low Profile Vessels* (LPVs) intercepted in the War on Drugs.

The unfinished craft is about 15m (50ft) long and made of fiberglass. Unlike LPVs it has to be cylindrical and have large ballast tanks to take in water so that it submerges. Both of these features limit the payload relative to a similarly sized LPV; 2 tons versus6 tons for an LPV. The ballast tanks are probably in the clearly separated fore and aft sections visible in the photos. Based on the very few similar designs previously seen, the drugs are likely in the keel and under the floor in the main hull.

 Colombian Forces destroyed the semi-sub and seized a modest stash of cocaine discovered nearby.
