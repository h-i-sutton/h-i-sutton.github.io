# China Is About To Go Public On Its Massive XLUUV Programme

![Flag China](/images/flag_China.jpg) China is preparing to reveal at least two of its extra-large uncrewed underwater vehicles (XLUUVs), basically drone submarines, at a military parade on September 3. One of the designs is labeled the AJX-002, and the other has an as-yet unknown designation.  

China does not have a track record of deception during parades, and its development budget is such that it doesn’t have to. These parades have traditionally been used to showcase new equipment, and unlike Iran and certain other countries, the equipment should all be taken seriously.   

China has been testing at least 5 distinct XLUUV designs since 2022, with recent unpublished satellite's imagery suggesting that the trials remain ongoing even now. Thus the scale of this development far exceeds any other country. What is more, there are indications that the Chinese types are weaponised to a greater degree, carrying torpedoes as well as mines. Western governments are significantly behind in this important regard. Arming of uncrewed underwater platforms with torpedoes is inevitable, and China will have years of experience others lack.

## AJX002

The AJX-002 is an unusual and enigmatic design. Its role remains unclear. Given its similar size and torpedo-like form there will naturally be speculation that it is a Chinese equivalent of the Russian Poseidon nuclear armed nuclear powered intercontinental torpedo. However there are no clear indications that it is nuclear powered. Nor does it appear to have diesel motors like the [North Korean 'Haeil'](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2023-07-29-North-Korea-Nuclear-Torpedo-Drone %}).  

It is around 18-20 meters long but just 1.1-1.2m in diameter. This gives it a length to beam ratio of about 16:1, much skinnier than even the longest crewed submarines. This great length, combined with traditional cruciform rudder arrangement and apparent absence of forward controls (hydroplanes or thrusters) may give it control issues. However China has 5 of the type at the parade (possibly one is the spare), suggesting that it is an operational type.   

Having said that, it is almost certainly weaponised. Such a large system, without substantial masts, is unlikely for ISR (intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance). Possibly the AJX-002 is some form of mine, possibly a self-deploying torpedo armed mine for deep water minefields (popularly a CAPTOR mine).

The arrangement of the lifting lugs suggests that it can be broken into two parts for transport. Logically the and section is propulsion and the forward section is for the payload. If so, the payload section could be large enough to accommodate a heavyweight torpedo or cruise missile.   

## Nuclear Propulsion?

There have been reports that Chinese scientists are promoting the concept of a nuclear propulsion kit for torpedoes which drops away after it is expended. I think that is less likely given the lifting lugs and how we’ve seen a XLUUV closely matching this (but possibly a couple of meters shorter) undergoing testing in Sanya.  

## Second XLUUV

The second design has so far been kept under wraps. We can however determine that it has a similar overall length, a similar pumpjet, but a larger diameter body. It also has X-form rudders, and at least two masts. This suggests that it is more of a general purpose design compared to the AJX-002. Its form appears to match one observed at Yulin several years ago, but is different from one observed earlier this year.
