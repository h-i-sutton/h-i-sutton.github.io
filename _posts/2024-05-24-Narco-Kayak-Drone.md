# Uncrewed Narco Kayak Found by Italy

An Uncrewed 'narco submarine', based on a fiberglass kayak has been discovered by Italian police. The [Torino Carabinieri reported](https://www.carabinieri.it/in-vostro-aiuto/informazioni/comunicati-stampa/collaudavano-un-sommergibile-radiocomandato-per-il-trasporto-della-droga-arrestati) that the vessel had been [tested on a lake](https://twitter.com/_Carabinieri_/status/1790342571635470506).   

A sail-like structure has been added over the cockpit opening. Two electric thrusters mounted on long arms below the vessel, one each side. These are on arms which can be folded forward, and presumably aid steering as well as propulsion. A rudder is mounted below the stern with a larger fixed stabilizer above.

The vessel was associated with an Italian-Albanian transnational organisation. Drugs are often smuggled by small vessels across the Adriatic from Albania to Italy. These vessels have on occasion included uncrewed boats, but this appears to be the first adapted from a kayak.
