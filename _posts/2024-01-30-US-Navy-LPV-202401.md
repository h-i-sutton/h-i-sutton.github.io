#Mystery Vessel Seen In San Diego Likely U.S. Navy 'Narco Sub' Transport![Flag USA](/images/flag_USA.jpg) A mysterious vessel observed in San Diego harbor appears to be a prototype low-profile transport drone (USV - uncrewed surface vessel). The design is strongly reminiscent of many so-called "narco submarines". Like so much in this field, most of it is hidden below the surface.  

The craft has an extremely low freeboard, just over 0.3 meters (1 ft) but the draft is five times more at 1.5 meters (5 ft). It is 21 meters (69 ft) long but just 2 meters (6.5 ft) across. The hull appears to be shaped like a sailing yacht but with twin engines so likely twin-screw. has been observed operating at speeds of up to 11.3 knots, which is also typical of narco-submarines.   

The vessel is registered in the U.S. as 65LP2202 and is reporting its position on MMSI 338482087 as a pleasure craft. It appears to have sailed from Norfolk, Virginia, to San Diego. Both ports are closely tied to the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). The photo and video were taken by San Diego watcher [@cjr1321](https://twitter.com/cjr1321) and shared on Twitter/X via [@WarshipCam](https://twitter.com/WarshipCam/status/1752093884241342744).

In the center of the craft there is a large square tarpaulin which appears to be over an open hold. This would be for the cargo. There is a simple A-Frame mast towards the back which mounts a navigation radar and other aids. This may be folding or removable and is possibly a requirement for testing at this stage. At the stern plastic covers what appears to be a flat satellite communication antenna, possibly Starlink.   

There is no accommodation for the crew. While it has been seen being operated by two persons using a hand-held control box, this is a strong indication that it is an uncrewed platform. Additionally, it has been observed in company with a U.S. Navy boat with an AUV (autonomous underwater vehicle) handling system. This strongly associates it with uncrewed programs.
