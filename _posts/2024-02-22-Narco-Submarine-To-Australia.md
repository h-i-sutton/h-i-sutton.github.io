#Photos Of First Trans-Pacific Narco Submarine Caught Heading To AustraliaA low-profile vessel (LPV), popularly termed a "narco-submarine", was interdicted on February 14 2024. Subsequent reports from the court proceedings suggest that it was [destined for Australia](https://www.eluniversal.com.co/home/incautan-4-toneladas-de-cocaina-que-iban-en-semisumergible-a-australia-AC10031274).   

The prospect of narco-submarines being used in the trans-Pacific drug trade have been researched previously. But this is the first time an interdicted narco-sub has been directly associated with the route.  

The narco-submarine was relatively large, being 18 meters (69 feet) long by 3 meters (10 feet) wide. It was the traditional sailing yacht-style hull with inboard motor and four crew. It is likely that this form of narco-submarine, termed LPV-IM for inboard motors, is now less common than ones with outboards (LPV-OM). Possibly they are seen as more reliable and/or seaworthy because the ones observed [crossing the Atlantic](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2023-03-13-Narco-Submarine-Spain-2023 %}) also used inboard motors. However we cannot rule out LPV-OMs making this route.

To aid the voyage the crew reportedly had with them:  

* 6 x GPS-79S positioners* 5 x satellite phones* 3 x VHF radios* A considerable sum of money in Colombian pesos and US dollars

It was carrying some 4 tonnes of cocaine (specifically 4,071 kg in 206 bales). This is not beyond the carry capacity of regular narco-subs but is about 2.5 times more than is typical. There is a strong demand for narcotics in Australasia and consequently very high street prices for cocaine. This potentially makes a more direct route from Colombia attractive.

It is plausible that the narco-submarine would only sail part of the way to Australia or New Zealand. It might rendezvous with a merchant ship sailing from North America. This ship will have sailed from a ‘safe’ port which might make it less suspicious to law enforcement. Sailing most or all the way is not out of the question however.
