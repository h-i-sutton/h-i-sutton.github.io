#Quick Guide To Angola's Navy![Flag Angola](/images/Flag_Angola.jpg) Many reference sources still list the Angolan Navy as having OSA-II Class missile boats and SHERSHEN class torpedo boats. These haven't been around for over 20 years. Instead the Angolan Navy is going through a process of rebirth with small but generally modern equipment. Very little is reported about them so here is a very quick, and not exhaustive, overview.   

The missile boats and torpedo boats were from an era when Angola received significant Soviet and Cuban support. With the collapse of the USSR and withdrawal of the Cubans their navy also fell into decline. Some Western types started to be acquired, although not in the same combat league as the soviet kit. Three small Patrulheiro class patrol boats were supplied by France in 1993. But by the early 2000s there were virtually no vessels serviceable.   

Since then they have been building up again however. In 2013 there was even talk of Angola acquiring the Spanish aircraft carrier Príncipe das Astúrias(!). Naturally this did not come to anything. But what they do have is intereting:  

##HSI-32 & DV-15 High Speed InterceptorLike the [Mozambique Navy](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2021-05-26-Guide-To-Mozambique-Navy %}) they have forged ties with CMN and acquired fast interceptors boats from them. Consequently the 3 HSI-32 interceptors are among the most modern equipment in the Angolan inventory. These relatively large boats are capable of open water operations at high speeds, reaching 43 knots. They were designed by CMN in France. Production is likely at a local factory set up by CMN's parent company, Privinvest. The deal was announced in September 2016 and the boats appeared in Luanda in late 2018.

Open Source Intelligence shows that Privinvest also supplied at least 3 of the smaller **DV-15** interceptors.

##Super Dvora Mk.III Patrol BoatsAnother recent acquisition is the Super Dvora Mk.III from Israel. Reports suggest four were ordered in 2015 and delivered in 2016. The 27.4 meter long craft can reach speeds of 45 knots and can be armed with a 20mm cannon or heavy machine guns.

##Macae Class Patrol Boats7 Macae class patrol boats, a variant of the CMN Vigilante 400 CL54 design, are reported to have been acquired. The deal, with Brazil, was announced in 2014 and several ships matching their arrangement have been observed in Luanda.

##Mandume Class Patrol BoatsFour aging Bazan Cormoran patrol boats were refurbished in 2009. Capable of 25 knots, they have been in poor shape over the years but appear better turned out in more recent photographs. They are known as the Mandume class: Mandume, Polar, Atlantico and Golfinho.

##Damen - Fisheries Research & ProtectionFor fisheries protection Angola turned to Damen in The Netherlands. One large research vessel, Baía Farta (type FRV 7417) and two Fishery Inspection Surveillance Vessels (type 6210 FISV) were delivered from the firm's Romanian yard. They are generally the largest boats in the Angolan inventory, although the research vessel is operated for the relevant government agency.
