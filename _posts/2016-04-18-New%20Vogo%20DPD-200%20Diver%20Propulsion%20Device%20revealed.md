![Flag](/images/flag_RoK.jpg) The new Vogo DPD-200 two-man diver propulsion device has been revealed at the 2016 DSA (Defense Services Asia) defense exhibition. Vogo have an established product line of underwater special forces craft including three, eight and ten-man SDVs (Swimmer Delivery Vehicles). Vogo have an established product line of underwater special forces craft including three, eight and ten-man SDVs (Swimmer Delivery Vehicles). The DPD-200 is the first small transport in the line-up and is designed to transport men and personal equipment over short distances, such as between a midget submarine or larger SDV and the shore.  

The DPD-200 fits neatly into the latest trends in Diver Propulsion vehicles (DPVs) and competes against the broadly equivalent *Stidd DPD* and *JFD TorpedoSEAL*.

The craft is roughly torpedo shaped with the top cut away to provide a partially shield laying position for the pilot and passenger. They are further protected from the oncoming water by a clear folding watershield. When folded into the storage position the craft is small enough to fit into standard torpedo tubes on submarines. To deploy, the batteries and propulsor is folded out over the stern to form a platform with the forward hull. There are no forward hydroplanes but the thruster appears to be steerable.
