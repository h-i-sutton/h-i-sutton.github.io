#New Improved Yuan Class Submarine In China, May Have VLS![Flag China](/images/flag_China.jpg) A new type of submarine has been observed at the Wuchang shipyard in Wuhan, China. The vessel was spotted by [Defense analyst Tom Shugart](https://x.com/tshugart3/status/1817535856107737093). The submarine is visible in satelite imagery. Initial analysis suggests that it is noticibly longer than the existing Type-039A/B/C Yuan Class, and also features an X-form rudder.

Until now Chinese submarines have not featured an X-form rudder, although some extra-large uncrewed underwater vehicles (XLUUV) have. X-form rudders are generally seen as superior to traditional cruciform rudders.   

The submarine is also longer by about 5-7 meters. This may reflect a change in propulsion, but it also hints at the possibility of vertical launch tubes.   

At this point it may be a new variant of the [Yuan Class]({% post_url 2021-07-08-Chinese-Type-039C-Yuan-Class-Submarine %}), or it might be an entirely new class of submarine.
