**SeeKrieger High Speed Coastal Defense Craft / Submarine**  

![Flag](/images/Flag_Singapore.jpg) The SeeKrieger is an ambitious submersible boat design from Singaporean based [DK Naval Technologies](http://dknavaltech.com/seekrieger/). If the performance matches specifications at 120 knots it will be the fastest naval vessel in the world in surface planning mode by a large margin. And submerged speed is reportedly equivalent to nuclear submarines at 30 knots, making it the fastest electric powered submarine in the world (?).

The vessel was unveiled at LIMA-2019 defense show in Malaysia on 26th March 2019 and was reported in [Naval News](https://www.navalnews.com/event-news/lima-2019/2019/03/lima-2019-dk-naval-technologies-lifts-veil-on-seekrieger-submersible-boat/).

DK Naval Technologies estimates surface speeds of up to 80 knots in the standard monohull mode, which increases to 120 knots when two retractable outriggers are deployed to optimize dynamic stability.
