I have previously attempted to illustrate INS Arihant based on the limited photographs then available ([HERE](Vanquisher of Enemies - INS Arihant.html)). In particular, the rear of the boat was never visible. Now an image of her on the surface has surfaced, revealing her overall profile in some detail. Note that she is sailing away from the camera so she looks shortened:

So I revisited my artist's impression and the only thing that I have had to change was the size and shape of the aft (rear) control surfaces:[![](/images/INS_Arihant_updated940.jpg)](/images/INS_Arihant_updated.jpg)*Original Artwork, click to enlarge!*

Just goes to show, you can piece together a lot from a few incomplete photographs!
