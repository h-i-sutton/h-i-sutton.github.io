#Unidentified Object On Chinese Navy Nuclear Missile Submarine![Flag China](/images/flag_China.jpg) An interesting video has surfaced on Chinese social media, shared on Twitter [HERE](https://twitter.com/louischeung_hk/status/1619600674333007872), of a Chinese Navy (PLAN) Type-094 Jin Class ballistic missile submarine.   

The submarine is seen on the surface with one of the starboard (right) missile hatches open (B). Behind that, on the aft of the raised missile deck casing, is an unidentified structure (A):   
![Chinese-Navy-Type-094-Jin-Class-SSBN](/images/China-Type-094-SSBN-Object.jpg)  

The structure does not appear to be a submersible, or rescue bell. It may be related to the towed communication buoy but appears too large.  

Given that the missile tube outer hatch is open it may be tests related.
