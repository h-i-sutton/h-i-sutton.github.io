#Another Trans-Atlantic Narco Submarine Found In Europe

If you go down in the beach tonight, you're sure of a big surprise,  
If you go down in the beach tonight, you'd better go in disguise,  
For every naughty boy ever there was,  
Will gather there for certain just because,  
Today's the day the narcosub lands its cargo...  

Another narco-submarine has been found in an isolated cove along the Galician coast in northern Spain. The vessel was discovered off Muxía, a headland on the north-west tip of the country. This is significant for several reasons:  

* It is the third large Trans-Atlantic narco-submarine discovered in the area. There have been well documented examples in [November 2019](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2020-03-03-Transatlantic-Narco-submarine-Galicia %}), and again in [March 2023](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2023-03-13-Narco-Submarine-Spain-2023 %}). This shows that the route remains active despite significant law enforcement efforts. There has generally been an [increase in observed transatlantic activity](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2024-06-28-Transatlantic-Narco-Submarines-202406 %}).* The details of the design is distinct from the previous two examples pointing to a new master builder behind it.* The vessel was able to unload its cargo, likely around 3 tonnes of cocaine, before it was discovered. Local law enforcement found numerous vehicle tracks on the beach.

The narco-sub was around 20 meters (65 ft) long and had a generic LPV (low profile vessel) arrangement. Unusually it has twin exhausts pointing to a twin-diesel arrangement. This is likely to increase reliability for the weeks-long Atlantic crossing.  

According to [local media](https://www.lavozdegalicia.es/noticia/carballo/2025/01/22/aparece-narcosubmarino-20-metros-eslora-ria-muxia-camarinas/00031737537816400230698.htm), the vessel broke in half and sank stern first. It is likely that the wreck will be recovered, as previous boats have been. But as these vessels become more commonplace, the novelty may wear thin.
