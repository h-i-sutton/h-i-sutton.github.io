#Iran's IRGC Shows Off New Warship![Flag Iran](/images/flag_iran.jpg) Iran showcased another batch of new boats for the IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp). The exact number of new vessels in these parades needs to be taken with a pinch of salt. But there is no doubt that the IRGC’s naval branch is growing in size and capability. It is gaining some increasingly potent equipment and some modern vessels. This time a new missile boat stole the show.   

The Abu Mahdi class is the latestmissile corvette for the IRGC. It is a catamaran with low-observable shaping and a generally futuristic appearance.

The ship was built at the Qeshm Madkandaloo Shipbuilding Cooperative Co. shipyard, on the island of Qeshm. This yard is closely associated with the IRGC and also builds the Shahid Soleimani class missile corvette. I have been watching the construction of this ship and it was previously [shown on Covert Shores](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2022-12-03-Iran-4th-Shahid-Soleimani-class %}) last year.  

At the ceremony, General Tangsiri, commander of Navy of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, described the ship as an "invisible boat". He stated that is capable of sailing for 14 days and 2,000 nautical miles,. It is powered by four engines and able to operate in sea states 5-6.  

The new ship is slightly smaller than the Shahid Soleimani class missile corvette. Overall it is similar in concept. The main trade-off is the size of the helicopter landing pad. On the new vessel this is sized for uncrewed air vehicles (UAVs), and looks too tight even for small helicopters to attempt a landing.The Shahid Soleimani class also has a hangar for three interceptor boats at the stern, something this lacks. We can therefore view this as a slightly less capable complement to them.

##Missile ArmamentThe boat's main offensive armament are six C-802 'Noor' family anti-ship missiles mounted across the stern. These are a Chinese base design but have been locally built and developed for over 20 years. Details on the launchers suggest that the extended range 'Qader' version of the missile is carried. This has a reported range of 300 km (160 nautical miles), provided that it has over-the-horizon targeting.  

There are also two sets of launch tubes amidships, beside the UAV landing deck. These can carry a total of 8 missiles (4 also seen). The exact type of missile is unconfirmed, but the launchers have been observed before on IRGC boats. Reports suggest that they are the 'Kosar' (or 'Kowsar', 'Kotsar') infrared guided air-defense missile. This is reputed to have a 15km range.

Iranian media has [previously described](https://en.mehrnews.com/news/200671/IRGC-vessels-equipped-with-cruise-missiles-with-2-000-range) a 'Kowsar 200' (also 'Kotsar 200') missile which has a range of 5-7 km and is capable of engaging UAVs, cruise missiles and helicopters. The 'Kowsar 222' has a range of 17 km.  

However all is not clear. Its carriage by Ashura class small boats with limited air-surveillance goes against the suggestion that this is an air defense system. And previously these were described as 'laser guided' missiles (which appears incorrect).   

'Kowsar' is also a name used for an Iranian version of the Chinese C-701 missile. This is about the right size and has a similar nose to the missiles shown. It has a 15 km range and a cruising speed of Mach 0.8. It seems unlikely that it is being used as air-defense if this is indeed the case.

*The Shafagh missile is another possibility. Variations of Iran's Hellfire and TOW copies (Ghaem 114 & Almas respectively) should also be considered.*  

##Gun ArmamentThere is a 30mm auto cannon on the forward deck in the same arrangement as on the Shahid Soleimani class. This mount is being seen on more IRGC ships in recent years including the old Tondar class missile boats. It is derived from the 2A42 off the BMP-2 infantry vehicle. It is automated but unlikely to constitute a close-in weapon system (CIWS) against missile threats.  

It is also armed with four Asefeh three-barreled 23mm gatling guns. These are derived from the 20mm XM197 cannon used on U.S. supplied Cobra attack helicopters which have been in Iranian service since the 1970s. The weapon has been rechambered for Russian 23x152mm ammunition which is widely used by Iran. It has a rate of fire of 1000 to 2000 rounds per minute.
