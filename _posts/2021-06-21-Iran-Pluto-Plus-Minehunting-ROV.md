#Iran Appears To Have Western Pluto Plus Underwater Vehicle![Flag Iran](/images/flag_iran.jpg) The words **Made in Iran** written on the side of the underwater vehicle may be misleading. Photos from the commissioning ceremony of the Iranian Navy's [first mine warfare vessel](http://www.hisutton.com{% post_url 2021-01-07-Iranian-Navy-Surface-Effect-Ship-Saba %}), Shahin (previously reported as [Saba](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2021/01/update-on-iranian-navy-surface-effect-ship-ses/)), shows an interesting Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV). It is a very strong physical match for the Pluto Plus ROV. That system was developed by [Idrobotica](http://www.idrobotica.com/pluto-plus.php) and is manufactured by Gaymarine SRL in Italy.

The ROV is designed to be used for naval mine clearance. It can help locate and identify bottom mines and moored mines. These would then be destroyed by clearance divers or other uncrewed underwater vehicles.   

The Pluto Plus is a mature system which was first fielded in the 1980s. Significant numbers (~150?) have been built and it has seen service around the world. Operators have included Norway, Egypt (built in US), Vietnam, Spain and Italy.
