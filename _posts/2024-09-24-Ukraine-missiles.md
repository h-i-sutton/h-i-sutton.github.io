# Guide To Ukraine's Longer Ranged Missiles

![Flag Ukraine](/images/flag_ukraine.jpg) Although missiles are normally outside my swim lane, I feel that this topic is a natural complement to the visual guides I prepared for [maritime drones (OWA-USVs)]({% post_url 2025-06-20-Russia-Ukraine-USVs-2024 %}) and [aerial drones (OWA-UAVs)]({% post_url 2025-07-06-Ukraine-OWA-UAVs %}).  

In approximate chronological order of their supply/use in Ukraine:  

## SS-21 SCARAB ('Tochka')

The Soviet-era SS-21 SCARAB (Tochka) missile was the backbone of Ukraine's tactical ballistic missile forces at the outbreak of the 2022 full-scale invasion. The weapon remains moderately capable and has scored some notable successes. These have included sinking the landing ship Saratov in Berdyansk on Sea of Azov in March 2022. This was the first major Russian naval loss of the war. Over time stocks have likely run low and the missile quickly became less prominent.

## Tu-143 Reys / Tu-141 Strizh

The Tupolev Tu-143 'Reys' is a Soviet-era jet-powered reconnaissance drone still in storage with the Ukrainian military. Since the 2022 full-scale invasion it has been weaponised and used as a crude cruise missile. The similar but older and larger Tu-141 'Strizh' has also reportedly been weaponised in the same way, although reports may sometimes mix the two.

## Neptune

The R-360 Neptune is a Ukrainian developed subsonic anti-ship missile based on the Soviet-era SS-N-25 SWITCHBLADE (Kh-35) missile. The weapon is generally equivalent to the Harpoon. In April 13 2022 two Neptune missile hit the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet (BSF), the Moskva. The cruiser sunk the next day.

## Harpoon

On June 17 2022, Ukraine sunk the Russian navy ship Spasatel Vasily Bekh with two RGM-84 Harpoon missiles (although some sources suggest Neptune). This was part of a series of events which led to Russia abandioning Snake Island. The ground launched missiles were likely part of an initial batch donated by Denmark. Subsequently the Netherlands, United States and possibly United Kingdom all supplied some Harpoon missiles. The missiles complement the Ukrainian produced Neptune missile.

## HARM

An anti-radiation missile designed to take out enemy radars, the AGM-88 HARM was supplied to Ukraine from summer 2022. Because it was integrated onto Soviet-era aircraft it can reportedly only be fired in basic operating modes.

## M-31 GMLRS

One of the most widely reported, and iconic, weapons of the Russo-Ukraine War, the 'HIMARS' has been hugely successful. HIMARS actually refers to the wheeled vehicle, the actual rockets are M-31 GLMRS (Guided multiple launch rocket system). These can also be fired by Ukraine's tracked M270 MLRS vehicles.

## Storm Shadow / SCALP-EG

The Storm Shadow (known as SCALP-EG in French form) is a long-range, air-launched, conventionally armed cruise missile. It was developed primarily for precision strikes against high-value, hardened, or well-defended targets. It was jointly developed by the UK and France, and it is manufactured by MBDA. Supplies to Ukraine were announced by the United Kingdom in May 2023. Subsequently both the UK and France supplied the missiles from their own stocks.  

![Storm Shadow / SCALP-EG Missile](/images/Ukraine-Missiles-StormShadow.jpg)  

In Ukrainian service the missile has been integrated with the Soviet era Su-24 FENCER strike aircraft. Each plane can carry two missiles, giving a typical volley of four-eight weapons per strike. Therefore, while the weapon is considered extremely potent, it is also very precious. The missile has been used to hit important military and naval targets, including Russian warships and the headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet.  

## SA-5 GAMMON (S-200)

Ukraine has shot some of its vintage Soviet-era SA-5 GAMMON ('S-200') surface to air missiles in a surface to surface role. Although large and long ranged, the weapon is not well suited, being something of a desperate measure.

## M-39 ATACMS

Following the success of the M-31 GMLRS (*'HIMARS'*) rocket, and then the British & French supply of the longer ranged Storm Shadow missile, the United States supplied the ATACMS missile in autumn 2023. The weapon is larger, longer ranged and more potent than the GLMRS. Although the missiles supplied to Ukraine have been older models, it has been considered very successful.

## AASM Hammer

France has been supplying a steady stream of AASM (Armement Air-Sol Modulaire) 'Hammer'. The weapon is essentially a guided 250kg bomb with a small rocket motor to extend range to around 70km (43 miles).

## JSOW

![Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW)](/images/Ukraine-Missiles-JSOW.jpg)  

The AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) is a GPS/INS (inertial navigation system) guided glide weapon. Despite being unpowered it can hit targets at more than 46 miles (74 km). Although the weapon had been widely discussed in the context of Ukraine, it was not until September 26 2024 that its supply was confirmed. The weapon is likely to be carried by Ukraine's F-16 aircraft.
