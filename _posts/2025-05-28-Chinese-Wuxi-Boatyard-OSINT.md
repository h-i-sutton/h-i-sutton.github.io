# Revealed: A Key Shipyard In Chain'a Naval Revolution

![Flag China](/images/flag_China.jpg) A small boatyard, backing onto a narrow urban canal, may be playing an outsized role in China's naval modernisation. The unassuming site is in Wuxi, west of Shanghai, and around 90 miles inland. Despite this, analysis indicates that it is building cutting edge uncrewed vessels.   

The yard, Wuxi Dongfang High Speed Craft Development Co, was the builder of the Jari USV (uncrwed surface vessel) in 2019. At the time it was an undisclosed location (and still [according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JARI_USV)). That location was this yard (vicinity 31.564°, 120.125°).

Wuxi Dongfang High Speed Craft Development Co., Ltd advertises itself as being "specialized in designing and manufacturing various high-speed official boats, commercial tourist boats, various high-performance and special purpose boats and yachts, and also operating various wharfs, water entertainment and other supporting facilities." The USVs are not mentioned. I believe that it has built several USVs, and likely also large uncrewed underwater drones (XLUUVs).   

The company appears connected to China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC) and in particular 702 Research Institute who developed the Jari USV. Logically other 702 Research Institute projects will be prototyped there.   

Watching this location may provide better awareness of Chinese maritime developments in the increasingly important uncrewed space.
