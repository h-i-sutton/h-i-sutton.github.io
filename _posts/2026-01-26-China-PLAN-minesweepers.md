Minesweepers are an often-overlooked corner of naval forces, especially in respect to heavily armed combatants and submarines. With around 60 vessels the Chinese Navy (PLAN) probably has the largest mine warfare fleet of any navy. And they are as poorly reported on as anyone else’s. This alone makes it an interesting topic for naval observers.

Mine clearing is inherently unglamorous (clearance divers may disagree!) and dangerous; as the saying goes, any ship can be a minesweeper, once. Naturally mine warfare vessels are divided into different roles and methods. China’s fleet, being the largest, has plenty of variation.

China modernised its minesweeper fleet broadly in line with its wholesale modernisation program starting in the 2000s. Several new types were introduced, and further enhancements are still being seen. This is a quick reference guide to Chinese Navy (PLAN) mine hunters and minesweepers.


## Type-082II Wozang Class minehunter
A larger and more modern minehunter constructed than earlier types the Wozang represented a major advance for the PLAN in the mid-2000s. The vessels have been observed operating an ROV closely resembling the PLUTO system familiar to NATO navies. 
![China’s Type 082II Wozang Class minehunter](/images/China-Minesweeper-Type-082II-Wozang-Class.jpg)

Displacement: 575-650 tons <br/>
Length: 55 meters <br/>
Beam: 9.3 meters <br/>
Draft: 2.6 meters <br/>
Propulsion: twin diesels with 2 Voith Schnieder propellers <br/>
Hull: non-magnetic steel <br/>
Speed: 14 knots <br/>
Armament: 1 twin 25 mm gun  <br/>

*Wozang class deploying an ROV generally similar to the PLUTO system. It is not identical and likely a close analogue rather than an exact copy. Sometimes labelled H/TJM-01, this ROV has been in PLAN service since at least 2007, and is only observed aboard the Wonzang class.*

Each ship can remotely operate up to 3 **Type-529 Wonang Class** inshore uncrewed minesweeping craft (MSI):

*Three Wonang Class vessels in close proximity to their Wozang Class mothership.*


## Type-081/081A Wochi Class minesweeper
Introduced in 2007 at the same time as the Wozang Class, these are larger yet less sophisticated. It is used for sweeping rather than hunting.
![China’s Type-081 Wochi Class minehunter](/images/China-Minesweeper-Type-081-Wochi-Class.jpg)

Displacement: 996 tons - 1200 tons <br/>
Length: 66 meters <br/>
Armament: 1 x Type 76 twin 37 mm naval gun (Type-081) or 1 x 25mm cannon (Tyoe-081A) <br/>

Following 4 Type-081s, 10 slightly improved Type-081As were built. These are marginally larger and feature an enlarged funnel and H/PJ17 30mm cannon forward. There does not appear to be a significant change in capability.

*Type-081A*

The Type-081/081A use an acoustic sweeping device which mimics a ship’s engine/equipment to detonate acoustic bottom mines.

*An ‘Otter’ used to keep the minesweeping line at a desired depth. A large number of these are carried aboard each vessel, partly explaining why the ships are larger than the Wozang class.*


## Type-082/082I Wosao-I/II Class minesweepers
1980s-generation small minesweepers still operated in modest numbers with around 16 in service.

*Two Wosao-II Class minesweepers.*

*A float for a minesweeping line. This exact design would be familiar to World War Two crews.*


## Inshore minesweeper, possibly improved Wonang Class
A small inshore vessel first observed in 2016 which appears to share its hull design with the Type-529 Wonang class MSI. The main difference, apart from the new superstructure, is a split transom for deploying a towed device, possibly a sonar towfish. There are also 4 x 6 launchers amidships, possibly for charges similar to those used for beach clearance. It is unclear how many have been built, possibly only one.

## New inshore minehunter 
Featured in the 2025 military parade in Beijing, this design is much more modern in both aesthetics and capability. A sonar towfish can be towed from the transom. The vessel may replace the Type-529 Wonang class.

## USV for beach clearance

## Underwater drones
Little information is available publicly on underwater drones (AUVs/UUVs) used for mine clearing. However, several suitable systems have been displayed at defence shows. 
![Chinese minehunter AUV](/images/China-Minesweeper-AUV.jpg)
*The BL100-MATT (upper) is a disposable mine neutraliser. Exact operation is unclear. The ST001 AUV multi-mission UUV (lower) developed for multiple roles including mine detection.*

![Chinese minehunter AUV](/images/China-Minesweeper-ROV.jpg)
*This underwater drone, displayed at World Defense Show in Saudi Arabia in 2024, appears to be for mine neutralisation. This may be a logical complement or successor to the H/TJM-01 PLUTO style system.*

![Chinese minehunter AUV](/images/China-Minesweeper-AUV-RS.jpg)
*The AUV-RS family of designs are advertised for, among many roles, mine clearing. Note the thrusters in a ‘puller’ configuration. Status is unclear.*

![Chinese minehunter AUV HTQ](/images/China-Minesweeper-AUVs.jpg)
*HTQ-220, HTQ-324 and HTQ-533 series of vehicles. No prizes for guessing the sizes.*
