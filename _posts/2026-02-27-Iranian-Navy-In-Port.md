As the world speculates on U.S. strikes on Iran, the Iranian Navy and I.R.G.C Navy (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps) are not showing significant signs of dispersing or otherwise attempting to protect their force. Vessels are in predictable locations, particularly around the major naval base at Bandar Abbas. 

The Navy and IRGC’s largest ships are berthed or anchored in Bandar Abbas in well known locations. The latest vessel, the converted tanker I.R.I.N Makran (441) is understood to be berthed just inside the outer harbour. A similar but slightly smaller converted tanker, I.R.I.N Kordestan (442) was berthed there yesterday and has likely moved to an anchoring position just outside the harbour to allow Makran in.

The I.R.G.C’s two large forward base ships, the I.R.I.S. Shahid Mahdavi (110-3) and I.R.I.S. Shahid Bagheri (C-110-4) are anchored in familiar spots south of the harbour entrance. The latter is the angled-deck ski-jump equipped drone carrier.

Within the harbour at least two of Iran’s KILO class submarines appear to be present, one in dry dock and the other at its usual pier. Many of Iran’s IR-120 Ghadir Class midget submarines are present, about the same number as normal, as are three Frigates, the intelligence (spy) ship and the amphibious warfare ships. One of the I.R.G.C’s new catamaran stealth missile corvettes seems to be berthed in its usual spot. 

Overall it does not appear that the Iranian navy, or IRGC, has attempted to increase the survivability of its naval assets in the event of American strikes. Possibly they believe that President Trump will back out of military strikes. Or that they will not be considered high enough priority to be struck, as in the last round of Israeli and American strikes. 

As with [Operation Praying Mantis in April 1988](https://www.history.navy.mil/browse-by-topic/wars-conflicts-and-operations/middle-east/praying-mantis.html)., then the U.S. punished Iran buy striking its naval forces, any attempt by the warships of the Iranian Navy (and now I.R.G.C) would likely be futile. 
Any Iranian naval action is therefore likely to employ unconventional forces such as small boats, uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) and underwater drones (UUVs).
